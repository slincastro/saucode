                3. **Input Validation**: The function already handles n <= 0, but consider adding type checking.
                4. **Performance Optimization**: For large values of n, the current implementation can be inefficient. Consider using memoization or a more efficient algorithm.
                5. **Return Type Consistency**: The function returns a list in all cases, which is good for consistency.

                # Explanation of Fibonacci Function

                This code defines a function called `fibonacci` that generates a Fibonacci sequence of a specified length.

                ```python
                {code}
                ```

                ## How it works:

                1. The function takes a parameter `n` which determines how many Fibonacci numbers to generate.
                2. It handles several base cases:
                   - If n â¤ 0, it returns an empty list
                   - If n = 1, it returns [0]
                   - If n = 2, it returns [0, 1]
                3. For n > 2, it:
                   - Initializes a list with the first two Fibonacci numbers [0, 1]
                   - Uses a loop to calculate each subsequent Fibonacci number by adding the two previous numbers
                   - Adds each new number to the list
                   - Returns the complete list

                The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
