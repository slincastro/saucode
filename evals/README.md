# Evals

1.- contains some blocks of code obtained from : "Classic Computer Science Problems In python" by David Kopec 
2.- Each Computer problem have a block of tests to guarantee the behavior is kept after the code improvement.
3.- evals notebook excecute and store the results of the experiments.
    - each experiment consist of a excecution 5 times the same block code and stre the results, we want to have 10 excercises with the tests.
