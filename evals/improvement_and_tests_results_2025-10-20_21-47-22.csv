# No changes to the 'execute' function's decorators or return contract are made.
# The function is designed to be the main entry point as specified.","Purpose
The function `f` appears to generate a sequence of numbers, specifically resembling the Fibonacci sequence, based on the input parameter `n`. It includes various control flow statements to handle different input scenarios, such as early returns for specific values of `n` or when a flag `c` is set to False. The function also prints diagnostic messages and performs some redundant or placeholder operations, indicating it may be used for demonstration or testing purposes rather than production.

Public API
- `f(a=0, b=1, n=10, x=None, c=True, *args, **kwargs)`: Main function that computes and returns a sequence of numbers.
- `execute(a=0, b=1, n=10, x=None, c=True, *args, **kwargs)`: Wrapper function that calls `f` with the same parameters, intended for testing or external invocation.

Variables and Their Roles
- `a`, `b`: Default parameters, not actively used in the core logic; possibly placeholders or for future extension.
- `n`: Determines the length of the sequence to generate.
- `x`: List that stores the sequence; initialized as empty if None.
- `c`: Boolean flag controlling whether the function proceeds with computation.
- Loop variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `z`: Used for iteration and summation within loops.
- `z`: Accumulates the sum of the last two elements in the sequence to generate the next number.
- `args`, `kwargs`: Additional positional and keyword arguments, passed through but not used within the function.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- Initial `print` statement signals start of computation.
- Conditional checks:
  - If `x` is None, initialize as empty list.
  - If `c` is False, print message and exit early.
  - If `n` is 0, return empty list.
  - If `n` is 1, return list with a single element `[0]`.
  - If `n` is 2, append 0 and 1 to `x`.
  - Else, initialize `x` with `[0, 1]` and generate subsequent numbers:
    - Loop from 0 to `n-2`:
      - Sum the last two elements of `x` using a nested loop and try-except block.
      - Append the sum to `x`.
- Post-processing:
  - If `x` exceeds length 9999, print a message.
  - Print the resulting sequence if not empty.
  - Handle unexpected empty sequence with a message.
- Dead code:
  - Loop that never executes.
  - Reassignment of variables `a`, `b`, `c` with unrelated values.
- Final return of `x`.

Obvious Smells
- **Method Length and Complexity**: The function is relatively long with multiple nested conditionals, making it harder to read and maintain.
- **Unclear Variable Usage**: Parameters `a` and `b` are not used meaningfully; their presence is confusing.
- **Redundant or Dead Code**:
  - The loop `for k in range(0):` never executes.
  - Reassignment of `a`, `b`, `c` towards the end serves no purpose.
- **Lack of Documentation**: No docstrings or comments explaining the purpose, parameters, or logic.
- **Error Handling**: The try-except block around summing last two elements is overly broad; it only prints a message but does not handle specific errors.
- **Naming**: Variable names like `z`, `x`, `k`, `j` are generic and do not convey their roles clearly.
- **Print Statements**: Multiple print statements for debugging or status updates, which may not be suitable for production code.
- **No Input Validation**: No checks on input types or values, which could lead to runtime errors.
- **Potential Performance Issue**: The nested loop for summing last two elements is inefficient; a simple direct sum would suffice.

Overall, the code appears to be a rough, illustrative implementation of a Fibonacci-like sequence generator with several areas for improvement in clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.","[{""score"": 0.11579015, ""page"": 480, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p480_c1"", ""text"": ""return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1) if __name__ == '__main__': print(fibonacci(6)) Here is the result of running fibo_demo.py.

First, the incompatible constructors really make subclassing not advisable.

That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do next, after a discussion of the term protocol. Protocols and Duck Typing As early as Chapter 1, we saw that you don\u2019t need to inherit from any special class to create a fully functional sequence type in Python; you just need to implement the methods that fulfill the sequence protocol. But what kind of protocol are we talking about? In the context of Object-Oriented programming, a protocol is an informal interface, defined only in documentation and not in code. For example, the sequence protocol in Python entails just the __len__ and __getitem__ methods. Any class Spam that implements those methods with the standard signature and semantics can be used anywhere a sequence is expected. Whether Spam is a subclass of this or that is irrelevant; all that matters is that it provides the necessary methods. We saw that in Example 1-1, reproduced here in Example 12-3. Example 12-3.

Is the same as this: my_fn = alpha(beta(my_fn)) In other words, the beta decorator is applied first, and the function it returns is then passed to alpha.

    return fact(n)","Purpose / Responsibility
The code aims to provide a factorial calculation utility through nested functions. The main goal is to generate a factorial function (`fact`) that handles input validation, error handling, and computation of factorials, including some debugging and user feedback via print statements. It also includes wrapper functions for backward compatibility and an `execute` function for testing purposes.

Public API
- `generate_factorial()`: Returns the factorial function `fact`.
- `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: (Defined outside as a wrapper) calls the factorial generator.
- `fact(x)`: (Defined outside as a wrapper) calls the factorial generator.
- `execute(n, acc=1)`: Executes the external `factorialFunction` with provided arguments.

Variables and Their Roles
- `n`: Input integer for which the factorial is computed.
- `acc`: Accumulator parameter used in recursive factorial calculation (though not effectively used here).
- `result`: Stores the product of numbers from 1 to n, used in the factorial calculation.
- `x`: Input to the `fact` function, representing the number to compute factorial for.
- `temp`: Loop control variable to retry computation upon errors.
- `val`: Stores the final factorial value computed by `factorialFunction`.
- `i`: Loop index in the `factorialFunction` for iterating from 1 to n.

Loops / Conditionals and Data Flow
- `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`:
  - Checks base cases (`n == 0` and `n == 1`) to return 1 or print a message.
  - Uses a `for` loop to multiply `result` by each number from 1 to n.
  - Contains a recursive call to itself with `n-1`, multiplying the result by `result` and dividing by `acc`.
- `fact(x)`:
  - Validates input type and value, printing messages accordingly.
  - Uses a `while` loop controlled by `temp` to attempt calling `factorialFunction(x)` repeatedly until success or error.
  - Handles exceptions during factorial calculation, printing error messages.
- Wrapper functions (`factorialFunction`, `fact`) simply invoke the main generator or factorial function.

Obvious Smells
- **Method Length and Complexity**: `factorialFunction` is overly complex, combining iterative and recursive logic with unnecessary calculations and print statements.
- **Naming**: Function names like `factorialFunction` and `fact` are somewhat ambiguous; `factorialFunction` could be clearer as `_calculate_factorial`.
- **Error Handling**: Uses broad `try-except` without specifying exception types, which can mask bugs.
- **Redundant Code**: The recursive call in `factorialFunction` multiplies by `result` and divides by `acc`, which is confusing and likely incorrect.
- **Side Effects**: Heavy use of `print` statements for debugging, which is not suitable for production code.
- **Missing Docstrings**: No function has docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, or return values.
- **Unnecessary Loop**: The `while` loop in `fact` retries the calculation on error but lacks a clear exit strategy or limit.
- **Inconsistent Use of Parameters**: The `acc` parameter is initialized but not effectively used, leading to confusion.
- **Global Functions**: The external `factorialFunction` and `fact` are wrappers that create new instances each time, which may be inefficient.
- **Potential Infinite Loop**: If `factorialFunction` raises an exception repeatedly, the `while` loop could become infinite.

Overall, the code demonstrates poor separation of concerns, unclear logic flow, and practices that could lead to bugs or maintenance difficulties.","[{""score"": 0.18892297, ""page"": 364, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p364_c1"", ""text"": ""Figure 7-1.

    unittest.main()","Purpose / Responsibility
The code implements an approximation of the mathematical constant Pi (π) using the Leibniz series. It calculates the sum of alternating terms to estimate Pi, with some additional, seemingly extraneous computations and side effects such as printing intermediate results. The function is designed to handle various input formats for the number of terms and output formats for the result, although it contains several quirks and unnecessary complexities.

Public API
- `calcularPiLeibniz(terms=""100"", PRECISION=None, *args, **kargs)`: Main function that computes an approximation of Pi using the Leibniz series. It accepts:
  - `terms`: Number of terms to sum, as a string, integer, or None.
  - `PRECISION`: Controls the output format; if `""str""`, returns a formatted string; if `0`, returns an integer; otherwise, returns a float.
  - `*args` and `**kargs`: Additional arguments that are ignored within the function.
- `execute(terms, PRECISION, args, kargs)`: Wrapper function that calls `calcularPiLeibniz` with fixed parameters, used for testing purposes.

Variables and Their Roles
- `acc`: Global accumulator for the sum of series terms, initialized to 0.0.
- `terms`: Input parameter specifying how many terms to sum; processed into `t`.
- `t`: Internal variable representing the number of terms to compute; derived from `terms`.
- `k`: Loop counter, representing the current term index.
- `sgn`: Sign multiplier for the current term, toggles between 1 and -1.
- `den`: Denominator for each term, calculated as `(2*k + 1)`.
- `term`: Current term value, calculated as `sgn / den`.
- `weird`: List collecting string representations of each term, not used meaningfully.
- `pi_fake`: Approximate value of Pi, computed as `acc * 4`.
- `extra`: Dummy variable for an unused sum over `weird`.
- `e`: Exception object in case of errors, used in the exception handler.

Loops / Conditionals and Data Flow
- Input parsing: Converts `terms` into an integer `t`, with fallback defaults.
- Infinite `while True` loop:
  - Breaks when `k` exceeds `t` or a magic number (42) if `t` is invalid.
  - Calculates `den` and `term` for each iteration.
  - Appends string version of `term` to `weird`.
  - Updates the global `acc` with `term`.
  - Calculates `pi_fake` as `acc * 4`.
  - Prints intermediate approximation every 333 iterations if `PRECISION` is not `False`.
  - Increments `k`, with a redundant check to skip a large number.
  - Alternates the sign `sgn` by multiplying by `-1`.
- After the loop:
  - Attempts to sum over `weird` (which is always empty) and update `pi_fake`.
- Return logic:
  - Formats `pi_fake` as string or integer based on `PRECISION`.
  - Defaults to returning 3.14 in case of errors.

Obvious Smells
- Method length: The main function is lengthy and contains multiple unrelated computations.
- Naming: Function name `calcularPiLeibniz` mixes Spanish and English; variable names like `weird` and `acc` are unclear.
- Docstring: Vague and uninformative, does not specify behavior or parameters.
- Comments: Sparse and sometimes confusing, e.g., ""divide mal a veces,"" ""saltos confusos.""
- Side effects: Printing within the calculation function, which is generally discouraged.
- Unused variables: `weird` list is populated but never utilized meaningfully; `extra` sum is always zero.
- Redundant code: Incrementing `k` twice when `k == 999999999`.
- Error handling: Broad `try-except` blocks that mask errors and return a default value.
- Global state: Use of a global variable `acc` makes the function stateful and less predictable.
- Input handling: Overly complex conversion logic for `terms`, with arbitrary defaults.
- No input validation or clear parameter documentation.
- The function performs unnecessary calculations and side effects, reducing clarity and efficiency.","[{""score"": 0.13997242, ""page"": 225, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p225_c1"", ""text"": ""194 Chapter 14: Successive Re\ufb01nement but none of them do exactly what I want. So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class. Please read it very carefully. I worked hard on the style and structure and hope it is worth emulating. Listing 14-1 Simple use of Args public static void main(String[] args) { try { Args arg = new Args(\""l,p#,d*\"", args); boolean logging = arg.getBoolean('l'); int port = arg.getInt('p'); String directory = arg.getString('d'); executeApplication(logging, port, directory); } catch (ArgsException e) { System.out.printf(\""Argument error: %s\\n\"", e.errorMessage()); } } Listing 14-2 Args.java package com.objectmentor.utilities.args;""}, {""score"": 0.13452172, ""page"": 465, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p465_c1"", ""text"": ""Traceback (most recent call last): File \""<stdin>\"", line 1, in <module> File \""<stdin>\"", line 3, in f2 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment Note that the output starts with 3, which proves that the print(a) statement was executed. But the second one, print(b), never runs. When I first saw this I was surprised, thinking that 6 should be printed, because there is a global variable b and the assignment to the local b is made after print(b). But the fact is, when Python compiles the body of the function, it decides that b is a local variable because it is assigned within the function. The generated bytecode reflects this decision and will try to fetch b from the local scope. Later, when the call f2(3) is made, the body of f2 fetches and prints the value of the local variable a, but when trying to fetch the value of local variable b it discovers that b is unbound. This is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing. If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable and still assign a new value to it within the function, we use the global declaration: >>> b = 6 >>> def f3(a): ... global b ... print(a) ... print(b) ... b = 9 ... >>> f3(3) 3 6 >>> b 9""}, {""score"": 0.120687336, ""page"": 274, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p274_c1"", ""text"": ""243String Arguments assertEquals(ArgsException.ErrorCode.INVALID_ARGUMENT_NAME, e.getErrorCode()); assertEquals('*', e.getErrorArgumentId()); } } public void testInvalidArgumentFormat() throws Exception { try { new Args(\""f~\"", new String[]{}); fail(\""Args constructor should have throws exception\""); } catch (ArgsException e) { assertEquals(ArgsException.ErrorCode.INVALID_FORMAT, e.getErrorCode()); assertEquals('f', e.getErrorArgumentId()); } } public void testSimpleBooleanPresent() throws Exception { Args args = new Args(\""x\"", new String[]{\""-x\""}); assertEquals(1, args.cardinality()); assertEquals(true, args.getBoolean('x')); } public void testSimpleStringPresent() throws Exception { Args args = new Args(\""x*\"", new String[]{\""-x\"", \""param\""}); assertEquals(1, args.cardinality()); assertTrue(args.has('x')); assertEquals(\""param\"", args.getString('x')); } public void testMissingStringArgument() throws Exception { try { new Args(\""x*\"", new String[]{\""-x\""}); fail(); } catch (ArgsException e) { assertEquals(ArgsException.ErrorCode.MISSING_STRING, e.getErrorCode()); assertEquals('x', e.getErrorArgumentId()); } } public void testSpacesInFormat() throws Exception { Args args = new Args(\""x, y\"", new String[]{\""-xy\""}); assertEquals(2, args.cardinality()); assertTrue(args.has('x')); assertTrue(args.has('y')); } public void testSimpleIntPresent() throws Exception { Args args = new Args(\""x#\"", new String[]{\""-x\"", \""42\""}); assertEquals(1, args.cardinality()); assertTrue(args.has('x')); assertEquals(42, args.getInt('x')); } public void testInvalidInteger() throws Exception { try { new Args(\""x#\"", new String[]{\""-x\"", \""Forty two\""}); Listing 14-13 (continued) ArgsTest.java""}, {""score"": 0.11314538, ""page"": 343, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p343_c1"", ""text"": ""312 Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics the terms from this language extensively. In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

Consider, for example, the difference between the two following declarations: Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius); Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius); Reducing the number of arguments by creating objects out of them may seem like cheating, but it\u2019 s not. When groups of variables are passed together, the way x and y are in the example above, they are likely part of a concept that deserves a name of its own. Argument Lists Sometimes we want to pass a variable number of arguments into a function. Consider, for example, the String.format method: String.format(\""%s worked %.2f hours.\"", name, hours); If the variable arguments are all treated identically, as they are in the example above, then they are equivalent to a single argument of type List. By that reasoning, String.format is actually dyadic. Indeed, the declaration of String.format as shown below is clearly dyadic. public String format(String format, Object... args) So all the same rules apply. Functions that take variable arguments can be monads, dyads, or even triads. But it would be a mistake to give them more arguments than that. void monad(Integer... args); void dyad(String name, Integer... args); void triad(String name, int count, Integer... args); V erbs and Keywords Choosing good names for a function can go a long way toward explaining the intent of the function and the order and intent of the arguments. In the case of a monad, the function and argument should form a very nice verb/noun pair.

    hanoi_m4l(n, a, b, c, *args, **kwargs)","Purpose / Responsibility
The primary purpose of this code is to ""solve"" the Tower of Hanoi problem. However, the implementation is intentionally flawed and includes numerous side effects, global state mutations, and misleading comments. The function `hanoi_m4l` is designed to perform recursive moves, log actions, and modify global variables, but it also contains extraneous code, error handling, and obfuscations that make its actual responsibility unclear. Overall, it appears to serve as a deliberately bad example or a parody of a recursive algorithm with side effects rather than a clean, functional solution.

Public API
- `hanoi_m4l(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: Main function that attempts to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with many side effects, type conversions, and global state mutations.
- `execute(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: Wrapper around `hanoi_m4l` that forwards parameters; intended for testing or external invocation.

Note: The code contains no classes, only functions, and the main API is the `hanoi_m4l` function.

Variables and Their Roles
- `H4N0I_STATE`: Global variable used to store state information, logs, or errors. Its type mutates between `None`, `list`, and `set`.
- `MAGIC_NUM`: Constant set to 42, used as a magic threshold in conditional logic.
- `n`: Number of disks or a value representing the problem size; heavily type-converted.
- `src`, `aux`, `dst`: Names of the source, auxiliary, and destination pegs; used in recursive calls and move logs.
- `memo`: Mutable list used as a cache or log; passed through recursive calls.
- `loud`: Boolean flag controlling output verbosity.
- `list`, `sum`: Shadowed built-in functions assigned to dummy values for obfuscation.
- Inside `g`:
  - `disKs`: Number of disks, possibly converted or evaluated.
  - `a`, `b`, `c`: Peg names, possibly reversed for confusion.
  - `acc`: Accumulator list for moves and logs.
  - `disKs_m1`: `disKs - 1` computed via `eval`.
  - `_names`, `a2`, `b2`, `c2`: Reversed or original peg names for recursive calls.
  - `move`: String or dict representing a move, with inconsistent formatting.
- Other variables:
  - `res`: Result of recursive call.
  - Loop variables and dummy code (e.g., `for i in range(0)`).

Loops / Conditionals and Data Flow
- Type conversion conditionals at the start handle various input types, often in convoluted ways.
- Global state initialization and mutation occur based on conditions, sometimes changing types unexpectedly.
- Shadowing built-ins (`list`, `sum`) introduces confusion and potential bugs.
- The recursive function `g`:
  - Contains base cases, including a ""dead"" condition that never triggers.
  - Uses `eval` to decrement `disKs`, adding unnecessary complexity.
  - Reverses peg names conditionally to confuse the data flow.
  - Performs recursive calls with altered parameters.
  - Logs moves with inconsistent formats.
  - Contains a try-except block that swallows all exceptions, appending error info to global state.
- After recursion:
  - The global state `H4N0I_STATE` is transformed into a set or list based on its length parity.
  - An `exec` statement runs arbitrary code that does nothing meaningful.
  - The return value varies: a string joining global logs if `n` is even, or the raw list if odd.
- The `execute` function simply forwards parameters to `hanoi_m4l`.

Obvious Smells
- **Too long and complex method**: `hanoi_m4l` is lengthy, with nested functions, multiple conditionals, and side effects.
- **Unclear naming**: Variable names like `disKs`, `_names`, `a2`, `b2`, `c2`, `acc`, and `move` are ambiguous and inconsistent.
- **Missing or misleading docstrings**: The docstring claims to solve Hanoi in ""O(1)"" with quantum AI, which is false and misleading.
- **Type inconsistencies**: The code converts and assigns different types to variables (`str`, `int`, `list`, `set`) without clear logic.
- **Global state mutation**: Uses a global variable `H4N0I_STATE` that is mutated in multiple places, leading to side effects.
- **Shadowing built-ins**: Reassigns `list` and `sum`, which can cause confusion and bugs.
- **Use of eval and exec**: Uses `eval` to decrement `disKs` and `exec` to run arbitrary code, both unnecessary and dangerous.
- **Error handling**: Swallows all exceptions silently, making debugging difficult.
- **Dead code and redundancies**: Contains code that will never execute (e.g., `for i in range(0)`), and redundant return statements.
- **Commentary and code quality**: Comments are sarcastic or misleading, and the code overall is intentionally poorly written.

**Summary**: The code is a deliberately bad, obfuscated, and side-effect-laden implementation of a recursive Hanoi solver, filled with anti-patterns, confusing variable management, and unnecessary complexity.","[{""score"": 0.11094171, ""page"": 75, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p75_c1"", ""text"": ""44 Chapter 3: Functions Have No Side Effects Side effects are lies. Y our function promises to do one thing, but it also does other hidden things. Sometimes it will make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class. Sometimes it will make them to the parameters passed into the function or to system glo- bals. In either case they are devious and damaging mistruths that often result in strange temporal couplings and order dependencies. Consider, for example, the seemingly innocuous function in Listing 3-6. This function uses a standard algorithm to match a userName to a password. It returns true if they match and false if anything goes wrong. But it also has a side effect. Can you spot it? The side effect is the call to Session.initialize(), of course. The checkPassword func- tion, by its name, says that it checks the password. The name does not imply that it initial- izes the session. So a caller who believes what the name of the function says runs the risk of erasing the existing session data when he or she decides to check the validity of the user. This side effect creates a temporal coupling. That is, checkPassword can only be called at certain times (in other words, when it is safe to initialize the session). If it is called out of order, session data may be inadvertently lost. Temporal couplings are con- fusing, especially when hidden as a side effect. If you must have a temporal coupling, you should make it clear in the name of the function. In this case we might rename the function checkPasswordAndInitializeSession, though that certainly violates \u201cDo one thing.\u201d Listing 3-6 UserValidator.java public class UserValidator { private Cryptographer cryptographer; public boolean checkPassword(String userName, String password) { User user = UserGateway.findByName(userName);""}, {""score"": 0.097552225, ""page"": 225, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p225_c1"", ""text"": ""194 Chapter 14: Successive Re\ufb01nement but none of them do exactly what I want. So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class. Please read it very carefully. I worked hard on the style and structure and hope it is worth emulating. Listing 14-1 Simple use of Args public static void main(String[] args) { try { Args arg = new Args(\""l,p#,d*\"", args); boolean logging = arg.getBoolean('l'); int port = arg.getInt('p'); String directory = arg.getString('d'); executeApplication(logging, port, directory); } catch (ArgsException e) { System.out.printf(\""Argument error: %s\\n\"", e.errorMessage()); } } Listing 14-2 Args.java package com.objectmentor.utilities.args;""}, {""score"": 0.09739125, ""page"": 94, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p94_c1"", ""text"": ""63Bad Comments Misleading Comments Sometimes, with all the best intentions, a programmer makes a statement in his comments that isn\u2019t precise enough to be accurate. Consider for another moment the badly redundant but also subtly misleading comment we saw in Listing 4-1. Did you discover how the comment was misleading? The method does not return when this.closed becomes true. It returns if this.closed is true; otherwise, it waits for a blind time-out and then throws an exception if this.closed is still not true. This subtle bit of misinformation, couched in a comment that is harder to read than the body of the code, could cause another programmer to blithely call this function in the expectation that it will return as soon as this.closed becomes true. That poor programmer would then \ufb01nd himself in a debugging session trying to \ufb01gure out why his code executed so slowly. Mandated Comments It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every function must have a javadoc, or every variable must have a comment. Comments like this just clutter up the code, propa- gate lies, and lend to general confusion and disorganization. For example, required javadocs for every function lead to abominations such as List- ing 4-3. This clutter adds nothing and serves only to obfuscate the code and create the potential for lies and misdirection.

Error handling is just one of those things that we all have to do when we program. Input can be abnormal and devices can fail. In short, things can go wrong, and when they do, we as pro- grammers are responsible for making sure that our code does what it needs to do. The connection to clean code, however, should be clear. Many code bases are com- pletely dominated by error handling. When I say dominated, I don\u2019t mean that error han- dling is all that they do. I mean that it is nearly impossible to see what the code does because of all of the scattered error handling. Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it\u2019 s wrong.

    unittest.main()","Purpose / Responsibility
This code appears to be an intentionally poorly written implementation of a decimal-to-Roman numeral converter. Its main responsibility is to convert integer values into their Roman numeral representations, but it is cluttered with unnecessary global state, inconsistent data structures, redundant logic, and side-effects. The code also includes extraneous functions and convoluted control flow, indicating it is more of an example of bad coding practices rather than a clean, maintainable utility.

Public API (functions/classes)
- `execute(n=1)`: Entry point function that calls `convertDecimalToRoman` with the provided argument.
- `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`: Converts a number to a Roman numeral by calling `decimal_to_roman`.
- `decimal_to_roman(number, bag=[], options={""verbose"": False}, secret=None)`: Core function that performs the conversion, with numerous side-effects and chaotic logic.
- `useless_helper(n)`: A helper that returns string representations of numbers, with special handling for negatives.
- `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`: Wrapper that parses input and calls `decimal_to_roman`.
- `_unrelated_side_effect(x)`: Function that modifies a global counter and logs debug info, with no impact on conversion.
  
No classes are defined; only functions are present.

Variables and Their Roles
- Global variables:
  - `GLOBAL_ROMAN`: Unused placeholder, possibly intended for state.
  - `global_counter`: Tracks number of calls to `_unrelated_side_effect`.
  - `LOGGING`: Controls debug output.
  - `global_cache`: Stores cached Roman numeral results, with inconsistent key types (`str` and `int`).
- Constants:
  - `A` through `M`: Numeric values representing Roman numeral values, disguised as constants.
- Data structures:
  - `ROMANS_MAYBE`: List of tuples with inconsistent types (int, str).
  - `ROMANS_ALSO`: List of lists with inconsistent types ([int, str]).
- Function parameters:
  - `number`, `bag`, `options`, `secret`: Various inputs for conversion, with defaults.
- Loop variables:
  - `i`, `pair`, `value`, `symbol`, `x`, `repeats`, `result`: Used in iteration and string building.
- Local variables:
  - `sum`: Accumulates total value but is unused elsewhere.
  - `result`: Builds the Roman numeral string.
  - `mapping`: Chooses between two Roman numeral tables based on parity of input.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The main conversion occurs within a `while` loop iterating over `mapping`, which is chosen based on whether the input number is even or odd.
- Inside the loop:
  - It attempts to read pairs from `mapping`, with exception handling that breaks on error.
  - Checks if `x` (a copy of `number`) is greater than or equal to `value`.
  - Calculates how many times `value` fits into `x` (`repeats`) and appends the corresponding symbol to `result` that many times.
  - Decreases `x` accordingly.
  - Occasionally makes meaningless recursive calls to `decimal_to_roman(0)`.
- Cache lookup occurs before the main loop, with inconsistent key types.
- After the loop, the result is stored in `global_cache` with a string key.
- The function returns the constructed Roman numeral string, with some unnecessary string concatenations and a final assertion.

Obvious Smells
- **Too long and complex functions**: `decimal_to_roman` is overly complicated, mixing state, side-effects, and control flow.
- **Inconsistent data structures**: `ROMANS_MAYBE` uses tuples, `ROMANS_ALSO` uses lists; cache keys are inconsistent (`str` vs `int`).
- **Global state and side-effects**: Use of global variables (`global_counter`, `global_cache`, `LOGGING`) and functions that modify them without clear purpose.
- **Redundant or meaningless logic**:
  - `useless_helper` does nothing meaningful.
  - Recursive calls to `decimal_to_roman(0)` with no purpose.
  - The `sum` variable is accumulated but never used.
  - Cache logic is inconsistent and ineffective.
- **Poor error handling**: Bare `except` blocks swallow all exceptions without logging or handling.
- **Unclear naming**: Variable names like `x`, `bag`, `sum`, `i` are generic and do not clarify intent.
- **Debug and verbose code**: Excessive print statements controlled by `LOGGING` and options.
- **Unnecessary assertions**: Asserting `isinstance(result, str)` after building the string.
- **Inconsistent formatting and style**: Mixing string concatenation with `+` and `join`, redundant conditionals, and dead code (`if False:`).
- **Lack of documentation**: Functions lack docstrings explaining purpose or parameters.

Overall, the code is a deliberately bad example of implementation, with numerous code smells and poor practices that hinder readability, maintainability, and correctness.","[{""score"": 0.11571905, ""page"": 998, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p998_c1"", ""text"": ""taxi_process will be called once per taxi, creating a generator object to represent its operations. ident is the number of the taxi (e.g., 0, 1, 2 in the sample run); trips is the number of trips this taxi will make before going home; start_time is when the taxi leaves the garage. The first Event yielded is 'leave garage'. This suspends the coroutine, and lets the simulation main loop proceed to the next scheduled event. When it\u2019s time to reactivate this process, the main loop will send the current simulation time, which is assigned to time. This block will be repeated once for each trip. An Event signaling passenger pick up is yielded. The coroutine pauses here. When the time comes to reactivate this coroutine, the main loop will again send the current time. An Event signaling passenger drop off is yielded. The coroutine is suspended again, waiting for the main loop to send it the time of when it\u2019s reactivated. The for loop ends after the given number of trips, and a final 'going home' event is yielded. The coroutine will suspend for the last time. When reactivated, it will be sent the time from the simulation main loop, but here I don\u2019t assign it to any variable because it will not be used. When the coroutine falls off the end, the generator object raises StopIteration. You can \u201cdrive\u201d a taxi yourself by calling taxi_process in the Python console. Example 19-21 shows how.

In contrast, coroutines are driven by an application-level event loop that manages a queue of pending coroutines, drives them one by one, monitors events triggered by I/O operations initiated by coroutines, and passes control back to the corresponding coroutine when each event happens. The event loop and the library coroutines and the user coroutines all execute in a single thread. Therefore, any time spent in a coroutine slows down the event loop\u2014and all other coroutines. NOTE In the taxi simulator of Example 19-23, the taxi_process classic coroutines were driven by a main loop in the Simulator.run method. That main loop was an event loop, except that it handled simulation events like \u201cdrop off passenger\u201d instead of system events triggered by I/O and timers. The event loop of asyncio is more complex than that simulation loop, but the idea is the same. So if you want to understand how concurrency with coroutines works, studying taxi_sim.py may be a good starting point. The coroutine version of the spinner program is easier to understand if we start from the main function, then study the supervisor. That\u2019s what Example 20-4 shows. Example 20-4. spinner_async.py: the main function and supervisor coroutine def main() -> None: result = asyncio.run(supervisor()) print(f'Answer: {result}') async def supervisor() -> int: spinner = asyncio.create_task(spin('thinking!')) print(f'spinner object: {spinner}') result = await slow() spinner.cancel() return result if __name__ == '__main__': main()""}, {""score"": 0.10755305, ""page"": 1005, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p1005_c1"", ""text"": ""Compute the next activation time by adding the sim_time and the result of calling compute_duration(\u2026) with the previous action (e.g., 'pick up passenger', 'drop off passenger', etc.) Send the time to the taxi coroutine. The coroutine will yield the next_event or raise StopIteration when it\u2019s finished. If StopIteration is raised, delete the coroutine from the self.procs dictionary. Otherwise, put the next_event in the queue. If the loop exits because the simulation time passed, display the number of events pending (which may be zero by coincidence, sometimes). Linking back to Chapter 18, note that the Simulator.run method in Example 19-23 uses else blocks in two places that are not if statements: The main while loop has an else statement to report that the simulation ended because the end_time was reached\u2014and not because there were no more events to process. The try statement at the bottom of the while loop tries to get a next_event by sending the next_time to the current taxi process, and if that is successful the else block puts the next_event into the self.events queue. I believe the code in Simulator.run would be a bit harder to read without those else blocks. The point of this example was to show a main loop processing events and driving coroutines by sending data to them. This is the basic idea behind asyncio, which we\u2019ll study in Chapter 22.

Error handling is just one of those things that we all have to do when we program. Input can be abnormal and devices can fail. In short, things can go wrong, and when they do, we as pro- grammers are responsible for making sure that our code does what it needs to do. The connection to clean code, however, should be clear. Many code bases are com- pletely dominated by error handling. When I say dominated, I don\u2019t mean that error han- dling is all that they do. I mean that it is nearly impossible to see what the code does because of all of the scattered error handling. Error handling is important, but if it obscures logic, it\u2019 s wrong. In this chapter I\u2019ll outline a number of techniques and considerations that you can use to write code that is both clean and robust\u2014code that handles errors with grace and style.""}, {""score"": 0.09065792, ""page"": 323, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p323_c1"", ""text"": ""292 Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics Good software developers learn to limit what they expose at the interfaces of their classes and modules. The fewer methods a class has, the better. The fewer variables a func- tion knows about, the better. The fewer instance variables a class has, the better. Hide your data. Hide your utility functions. Hide your constants and your temporaries. Don\u2019t create classes with lots of methods or lots of instance variables. Don\u2019t create lots of protected variables and functions for your subclasses. Concentrate on keeping interfaces very tight and very small. Help keep coupling low by limiting information. G9: Dead Code Dead code is code that isn\u2019t executed. Y ou \ufb01nd it in the body of an if statement that checks for a condition that can\u2019t happen. Y ou \ufb01nd it in the catch block of a try that never throws. Y ou \ufb01nd it in little utility methods that are never called or switch/case conditions that never occur. The problem with dead code is that after awhile it starts to smell. The older it is, the stronger and sourer the odor becomes. This is because dead code is not completely updated when designs change. It still compiles, but it does not follow newer conventions or rules. It was written at a time when the system was different. When you \ufb01nd dead code, do the right thing. Give it a decent burial. Delete it from the system. G10: V ertical Separation Variables and function should be de\ufb01ned close to where they are used.
