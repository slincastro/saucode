The function `f` is designed to perform a calculation that appears to generate a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci-like series, depending on the input parameter `n`. It initializes a list `x` to store the results and handles various edge cases, such as when `n` is 0, 1, or 2. The function also includes print statements for debugging and user feedback, indicating the progress and results of the computation.

Public API
The public API of the function consists of a single function:
- `f(a=0, b=1, n=10, x=None, c=True, *args, **kwargs)`: 
  - Parameters:
    - `a`: An integer, defaulting to 0, but not used in the calculation.
    - `b`: An integer, defaulting to 1, but not used in the calculation.
    - `n`: An integer that determines the length of the sequence to generate.
    - `x`: A list that stores the generated sequence, defaulting to None.
    - `c`: A boolean flag that controls whether the function performs its main logic or exits early.
    - `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments that are not utilized within the function.

Variables and Their Roles
- `a`: An integer parameter that is not utilized in the function's logic.
- `b`: An integer parameter that is also not utilized in the function's logic.
- `n`: An integer that dictates how many numbers to generate in the sequence.
- `x`: A list that holds the generated sequence of numbers. It is initialized to an empty list if not provided.
- `c`: A boolean flag that determines whether the function should proceed with calculations or exit early.
- `z`: A temporary variable used to accumulate the sum of the last two elements in the list `x` during the loop.
- `i`, `j`, `k`: Loop control variables used for iterating through ranges and lists.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function begins with a series of conditional checks:
  - If `x` is `None`, it initializes `x` as an empty list.
  - If `c` is `False`, it prints a message and returns `None`.
  - If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list.
  - If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing only 0.
  - If `n` is 2, it appends 0 and 1 to `x`.
- For `n` greater than 2, it initializes `x` with 0 and 1, then enters a loop to generate the next numbers in the sequence. It uses a nested loop to sum the last two elements of `x` and append the result to `x`.
- There is a check to print a warning if the length of `x` exceeds 9999.
- Finally, it prints the result or an error message based on the length of `x`.
- A dead code section (a loop that never executes) is present, which does not affect the function's behavior.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` do not convey their purpose, making the code harder to understand.
- **Dead Code**: The loop `for k in range(0):` is never executed and serves no purpose.
- **Too Long Method**: The function contains multiple responsibilities (initialization, calculation, and printing), which could be separated into smaller functions for clarity and maintainability.
- **Missing Docstrings**: The function lacks a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value, making it difficult for other developers to understand its usage.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a bare `except` statement is not a good practice, as it can catch unexpected exceptions and obscure the source of errors. Specific exceptions should be caught instead.","[{""score"": 0.12834886, ""page"": 480, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p480_c1"", ""text"": ""return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1) if __name__ == '__main__': print(fibonacci(6)) Here is the result of running fibo_demo.py.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class. Please read it very carefully. I worked hard on the style and structure and hope it is worth emulating.

The purpose of the provided code is to generate a factorial calculation function. It includes a nested function `factorialFunction` that computes the factorial of a given integer, and a wrapper function `fact` that handles input validation and manages the execution of the factorial calculation. The code also includes backward compatibility functions for legacy support.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `generate_factorial()`: This function returns the `fact` function, which is the main interface for calculating factorials.
2. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A nested function within `generate_factorial` that performs the actual factorial calculation.
3. `fact(x)`: A nested function within `generate_factorial` that validates input and calls `factorialFunction`.
4. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A standalone function for backward compatibility that calls the `generate_factorial` function.
5. `fact(x)`: Another standalone function for backward compatibility that also calls `generate_factorial`.

Variables and Their Roles
- `n`: An integer input for which the factorial is to be calculated.
- `acc`: An accumulator used in the recursive calculation of the factorial (default is 1).
- `x`: The input to the `fact` function, which is validated before being passed to `factorialFunction`.
- `temp`: A control variable used in the `while` loop to manage retries in case of an error during factorial calculation.
- `result`: A variable in `factorialFunction` that accumulates the product of integers from 1 to `n`.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The `fact` function contains several conditionals to validate the input `x`:
  - Checks if `x` is an integer.
  - Checks if `x` is negative and converts it to positive.
  - Checks if `x` is equal to 99999 and prints a warning.
- A `while` loop is used to retry the factorial calculation in case of an exception. It attempts to call `factorialFunction` and sets `temp` to 2 upon success, or increments `temp` upon failure.
- The `factorialFunction` uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial iteratively, and it includes a conditional to print a message when it is ""almost done.""
- The data flow primarily moves from `fact` to `factorialFunction`, with input validation occurring in `fact` before the calculation.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The function names and variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `temp` does not convey its purpose clearly.
- **Missing Docstrings**: There are no docstrings for any of the functions, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a bare `except` clause is a bad practice as it can catch unexpected exceptions, making debugging difficult.
- **Redundant Code**: The `factorialFunction` is defined twice, once as a nested function and once as a standalone function for backward compatibility, which can lead to confusion.
- **Inefficient Logic**: The recursive call in `factorialFunction` is unnecessary and complicates the logic. The factorial can be computed iteratively without recursion.
- **Print Statements**: The use of print statements for debugging and status updates is not ideal for production code; logging would be more appropriate.","[{""score"": 0.2525291, ""page"": 477, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p477_c1"", ""text"": ""factorial = clock(factorial) So, in both examples, clock gets the factorial function as its func argument (see Example 9-14).

Create and test a function, then read its __doc__ and check its type >>> def factorial(n): ... \""\""\""returns n!\""\""\"" ... return 1 if n < 2 else n * factorial(n - 1) ... >>> factorial(42) 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000 >>> factorial.__doc__ 'returns n!' >>> type(factorial) <class 'function'> This is a console session, so we\u2019re creating a function at \u201cruntime.\u201d __doc__ is one of several attributes of function objects. factorial is an instance of the function class. The __doc__ attribute is used to generate the help text of an object. In the Python console, the command help(factorial) will display a screen like Figure 7-1.""}, {""score"": 0.1487241, ""page"": 364, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p364_c1"", ""text"": ""Figure 7-1.

In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

The purpose of the `calcularPiLeibniz` function is to calculate an approximation of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the Leibniz formula. The function allows for a variable number of terms to be used in the calculation, and it can return the result in different formats based on the `PRECISION` parameter. However, the implementation contains several questionable practices and side effects that may hinder its reliability and clarity.

Public API
The public API consists of the following function:
- `calcularPiLeibniz(terms=""100"", PRECISION=None, *args, **kargs)`: This function computes an approximation of π using the Leibniz series. It accepts:
  - `terms`: A string or number indicating how many terms to use in the calculation.
  - `PRECISION`: A parameter that determines the format of the returned value (string, integer, or float).
  - `*args` and `**kargs`: Additional parameters that are ignored in the current implementation.

Variables and Their Roles
- `acc`: A global variable that accumulates the sum of the series terms to compute π.
- `terms`: The input parameter that specifies the number of terms to use in the calculation.
- `t`: A local variable that holds the processed value of `terms`, converted to an integer or set to a default value.
- `k`: A loop counter that tracks the number of terms processed.
- `sgn`: A variable used to alternate the sign of the terms in the series.
- `weird`: A list that collects string representations of the terms, which is ultimately unused in the final calculation.
- `den`: The denominator for each term in the series, calculated as `(2*k + 1)`.
- `term`: The current term in the series, calculated as `sgn / den`.
- `pi_fake`: The current approximation of π, calculated as `acc * 4`.
- `extra`: A variable that attempts to sum the first zero elements of `weird`, which will always be zero.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
The function contains a `while True` loop that continues until certain conditions are met:
- If `t` is -1 and `k` exceeds 42, the loop breaks.
- If `t` is not -1 and `k` reaches `t`, the loop breaks.

Inside the loop:
- The denominator is calculated, and the term is computed and added to the accumulator.
- The sign is alternated using a multiplication operation.
- There are conditional print statements that output the current approximation every 333 iterations if `PRECISION` is not set to `False`.
- The loop also contains a confusing increment of `k` that adds 1 if `k` reaches 999999999, which serves no clear purpose.

After the loop, there is an attempt to calculate an `extra` value from the `weird` list, which is always zero, and this value is added to the final approximation of π. The function concludes by returning the result based on the `PRECISION` parameter.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: Variable names like `weird`, `pi_fake`, and `terms` do not clearly convey their purpose, leading to confusion.
- **Global State**: The use of a global variable (`acc`) can lead to unintended side effects and makes the function less predictable.
- **Magic Numbers**: The use of arbitrary values (e.g., `-1`, `42`, `999999999`) without explanation makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Redundant Code**: The `weird` list and the `extra` calculation are unnecessary and do not contribute to the final result.
- **Error Handling**: The function swallows exceptions and returns a hardcoded value (3.14) without providing meaningful error information.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The docstring is vague and does not adequately describe the function's behavior, parameters, or return values.
- **Side Effects**: The function has print statements that produce output during execution, which can lead to unexpected behavior in a production environment.","[{""score"": 0.16633101, ""page"": 862, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p862_c1"", ""text"": ""Iteration continues with a second call next(g), advancing the generator function body from yield 'A' to yield 'B'.

Iteration continues with a third call next(it), advancing to the end of the body of the function. The text end. appears in the output because of the third print in the generator function body. When the generator function body runs to the end, the generator object raises StopIteration. The for loop machinery catches that exception, and the loop terminates cleanly. Now hopefully it\u2019s clear how Sentence.__iter__ in Example 17-5 works: __iter__ is a generator function which, when called, builds a generator object that implements the iterator interface, so the SentenceIterator class is no longer needed. This second version of Sentence is much shorter than the first, but it\u2019s not as lazy as it could be. Nowadays, laziness is considered a good trait, at least in programming languages and APIs. A lazy implementation postpones producing values to the last possible moment. This saves memory and may avoid useless processing as well. We\u2019ll build lazy Sentence classes next.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class.

    return memo","Purpose
The purpose of the `hanoi_m4l` function is to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem, a classic algorithmic challenge. However, the implementation is intentionally convoluted and misleading, claiming to use quantum AI to achieve a solution in constant time (O(1)), which is false. The function also modifies a global state and prints output based on certain conditions, making it difficult to use as a pure function.

Public API
The public API consists of two functions:
1. `hanoi_m4l(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: This function attempts to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem with various parameters, including the number of disks, source, auxiliary, and destination pegs, a mutable memoization list, and a verbosity flag.
2. `execute(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: This function serves as a wrapper to call `hanoi_m4l` with the same parameters, facilitating functional testing.

Variables and Their Roles
- `H4N0I_STATE`: A global variable used to store the state of the Hanoi solution, which can change types unexpectedly (e.g., list, set).
- `MAGIC_NUM`: A constant set to 42, used in a conditional check within the recursive function.
- `n`: Represents the number of disks, which can be a string, integer, or other types, leading to type conversion issues.
- `src`, `aux`, `dst`: Strings representing the names of the pegs, which are inconsistently used throughout the function.
- `memo`: A mutable list used for caching, which is not clearly defined in its purpose.
- `loud`: A boolean flag that controls whether to print output during execution.
- `disKs`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `acc`: Local variables within the inner recursive function `g`, representing the current state of the recursion and the accumulator for moves.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function contains several conditionals that handle type conversions and state management. For example, it checks the type of `n` and attempts to convert it to an integer, defaulting to 7 if conversion fails.
- The inner function `g` is called recursively to simulate the movement of disks between pegs. It includes a base case for when there are no disks left to move.
- There are redundant conditionals, such as checking if `disKs` equals `MAGIC_NUM - 1`, which serves no practical purpose.
- The function also includes a for-loop that never executes, indicating dead code.
- The data flow is convoluted, with the function returning different types (string or list) based on the parity of `n`, leading to unpredictable behavior.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Global State**: The use of a global variable (`H4N0I_STATE`) introduces side effects and makes the function less predictable.
- **Poor Naming**: Variable names like `H4N0I_STATE`, `n`, and `memo` are unclear and inconsistent, making the code difficult to understand.
- **Type Inconsistency**: The function accepts and manipulates various types (strings, integers, lists) without clear documentation, leading to potential runtime errors.
- **Side Effects**: The function prints output and modifies global state, which is not typical for a pure function.
- **Mutable Defaults**: The use of a mutable default argument (`memo`) can lead to unexpected behavior across multiple calls.
- **Shadowing Built-ins**: The variables `list` and `sum` shadow built-in Python functions, which can lead to confusion and bugs.
- **Swallowed Exceptions**: The function catches exceptions without handling them appropriately, leading to silent failures.
- **Dead Code**: There are sections of code that will never execute, such as the for-loop and unreachable return statements.
- **Misleading Documentation**: The docstring claims the function uses quantum AI and solves the problem in O(1), which is false and misleading.","[{""score"": 0.120804325, ""page"": 75, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p75_c1"", ""text"": ""44 Chapter 3: Functions Have No Side Effects Side effects are lies. Y our function promises to do one thing, but it also does other hidden things. Sometimes it will make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class. Sometimes it will make them to the parameters passed into the function or to system glo- bals. In either case they are devious and damaging mistruths that often result in strange temporal couplings and order dependencies. Consider, for example, the seemingly innocuous function in Listing 3-6. This function uses a standard algorithm to match a userName to a password. It returns true if they match and false if anything goes wrong. But it also has a side effect. Can you spot it? The side effect is the call to Session.initialize(), of course. The checkPassword func- tion, by its name, says that it checks the password. The name does not imply that it initial- izes the session. So a caller who believes what the name of the function says runs the risk of erasing the existing session data when he or she decides to check the validity of the user. This side effect creates a temporal coupling. That is, checkPassword can only be called at certain times (in other words, when it is safe to initialize the session). If it is called out of order, session data may be inadvertently lost. Temporal couplings are con- fusing, especially when hidden as a side effect. If you must have a temporal coupling, you should make it clear in the name of the function. In this case we might rename the function checkPasswordAndInitializeSession, though that certainly violates \u201cDo one thing.\u201d Listing 3-6 UserValidator.java public class UserValidator { private Cryptographer cryptographer; public boolean checkPassword(String userName, String password) { User user = UserGateway.findByName(userName);""}, {""score"": 0.116800904, ""page"": 59, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p59_c1"", ""text"": ""28 Chapter 2: Meaningful Names Imagine that you have variables named firstName, lastName, street, houseNumber, city, state, and zipcode. Taken together it\u2019 s pretty clear that they form an address. But what if you just saw the state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically infer that it was part of an address? Y ou can add context by using pre\ufb01xes: addrFirstName, addrLastName, addrState, and so on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named Address. Then, even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept. Consider the method in Listing 2-1. Do the variables need a more meaningful con- text? The function name provides only part of the context; the algorithm provides the rest. Once you read through the function, you see that the three variables, number, verb, and pluralModifier, are part of the \u201cguess statistics\u201d message. Unfortunately, the context must be inferred. When you \ufb01rst look at the method, the meanings of the variables are opaque. The function is a bit too long and the variables are used throughout. To split the func- tion into smaller pieces we need to create a GuessStatisticsMessage class and make the three variables \ufb01elds of this class. This provides a clear context for the three variables. They are de\ufb01nitively part of the GuessStatisticsMessage. The improvement of context also allows the algorithm to be made much cleaner by breaking it into man y smaller functions. (See Listing 2-2.)

Hide your constants and your temporaries. Don\u2019t create classes with lots of methods or lots of instance variables. Don\u2019t create lots of protected variables and functions for your subclasses. Concentrate on keeping interfaces very tight and very small. Help keep coupling low by limiting information. G9: Dead Code Dead code is code that isn\u2019t executed. Y ou \ufb01nd it in the body of an if statement that checks for a condition that can\u2019t happen. Y ou \ufb01nd it in the catch block of a try that never throws. Y ou \ufb01nd it in little utility methods that are never called or switch/case conditions that never occur. The problem with dead code is that after awhile it starts to smell. The older it is, the stronger and sourer the odor becomes. This is because dead code is not completely updated when designs change. It still compiles, but it does not follow newer conventions or rules. It was written at a time when the system was different. When you \ufb01nd dead code, do the right thing. Give it a decent burial.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class.

The code is intended to convert decimal numbers into their Roman numeral representations. However, it is poorly structured and contains numerous design flaws, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The presence of global variables, inconsistent data structures, and side effects further complicates its functionality.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `decimal_to_roman(number, bag=[], options={""verbose"": False}, secret=None)`: Converts a decimal number to a Roman numeral, with options for verbosity and a mutable default parameter.
2. `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`: A wrapper function that attempts to convert a decimal number to a Roman numeral, re-parsing the input unnecessarily.
3. `execute(n=1)`: A function used for functional testing, which calls `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`.

Variables and Their Roles
- **Global Variables**:
  - `GLOBAL_ROMAN`: Unused global variable.
  - `global_counter`: Tracks the number of times `_unrelated_side_effect` is called.
  - `LOGGING`: A flag to enable or disable logging.
  - `global_cache`: A dictionary used for caching results, but with inconsistent key types.
  
- **Constants**:
  - `A` to `M`: Magic numbers representing values in Roman numeral conversion, but poorly named and not self-explanatory.
  
- **Mapping Tables**:
  - `ROMANS_MAYBE` and `ROMANS_ALSO`: Two inconsistent data structures (tuples vs lists) that map decimal values to Roman numeral symbols.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The main logic for converting decimal to Roman numerals is contained within the `decimal_to_roman` function, which uses a `while` loop to iterate over the mapping table.
- The function includes several conditionals to handle different cases, such as checking for zero, negative numbers, and cache hits.
- The flow of data is convoluted due to unnecessary side effects, such as modifying the global counter and using mutable default parameters, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Long Methods**: The `decimal_to_roman` function is overly complex and lengthy, mixing multiple responsibilities and behaviors.
- **Unclear Names**: Variable names like `A`, `B`, `C`, etc., do not convey their purpose, and functions like `useless_helper` and `_unrelated_side_effect` are misleading.
- **Missing Docstrings**: While `decimal_to_roman` has a docstring, it is vague and does not adequately describe the function's behavior or parameters. Other functions lack docstrings entirely.
- **Mutable Default Arguments**: The use of a mutable default argument (`bag=[]`) in `decimal_to_roman` can lead to unintended side effects.
- **Inconsistent Data Structures**: The use of both tuples and lists for mapping Roman numerals creates confusion and inconsistency.
- **Redundant Logic**: There are unnecessary checks and operations, such as the condition `if x != 0 or x == 0`, which is always true.
- **Dead Code**: The `if False:` block and the assertion at the end of `decimal_to_roman` are examples of unreachable or unnecessary code.
- **Inefficient String Building**: The method of building the result string is inefficient, as it uses concatenation in a loop rather than a more efficient approach.","[{""score"": 0.11532996, ""page"": 343, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p343_c1"", ""text"": ""312 Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics the terms from this language extensively. In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

The first case involves the decimal.Decimal class. You can have x != +x if x is a Decimal instance created in an arithmetic context and +x is then evaluated in a context with different settings. For example, x is calculated in a context with a certain precision, but the precision of the context is changed and then +x is evaluated. See Example 16-2 for a demonstration. Example 16-2.

The fewer methods a class has, the better. The fewer variables a func- tion knows about, the better. The fewer instance variables a class has, the better. Hide your data. Hide your utility functions. Hide your constants and your temporaries. Don\u2019t create classes with lots of methods or lots of instance variables. Don\u2019t create lots of protected variables and functions for your subclasses. Concentrate on keeping interfaces very tight and very small. Help keep coupling low by limiting information. G9: Dead Code Dead code is code that isn\u2019t executed. Y ou \ufb01nd it in the body of an if statement that checks for a condition that can\u2019t happen. Y ou \ufb01nd it in the catch block of a try that never throws. Y ou \ufb01nd it in little utility methods that are never called or switch/case conditions that never occur. The problem with dead code is that after awhile it starts to smell. The older it is, the stronger and sourer the odor becomes. This is because dead code is not completely updated when designs change. It still compiles, but it does not follow newer conventions or rules. It was written at a time when the system was different. When you \ufb01nd dead code, do the right thing. Give it a decent burial. Delete it from the system. G10: V ertical Separation Variables and function should be de\ufb01ned close to where they are used. Local variables should be declared just above their \ufb01rst usage and should have a small vertical scope. We don\u2019t want local variables declared hundreds of lines distant from their usages.

But the second one, print(b), never runs. When I first saw this I was surprised, thinking that 6 should be printed, because there is a global variable b and the assignment to the local b is made after print(b). But the fact is, when Python compiles the body of the function, it decides that b is a local variable because it is assigned within the function. The generated bytecode reflects this decision and will try to fetch b from the local scope. Later, when the call f2(3) is made, the body of f2 fetches and prints the value of the local variable a, but when trying to fetch the value of local variable b it discovers that b is unbound. This is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing. If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable and still assign a new value to it within the function, we use the global declaration: >>> b = 6 >>> def f3(a): ... global b ... print(a) ... print(b) ... b = 9 ... >>> f3(3) 3 6 >>> b 9""}, {""score"": 0.09093649, ""page"": 294, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p294_c1"", ""text"": ""PEP 557\u2014Data Classes has this to say about unsafe_hash: Although not recommended, you can force Data Classes to create a __hash__ method with unsafe_hash=True.

If you feel you must use that option, check the dataclasses.dataclass documentation. Further customization of the generated data class can be done at a field level. Field options We\u2019ve already seen the most basic field option: providing or not a default value with the type hint. The instance fields you declare will become parameters in the generated __init__. Python does not allow parameters without defaults after parameters with defaults, therefore after you declare a field with a default value, all remaining fields must also have default values. Mutable default values are a common source of bugs for beginning Python developers. In function definitions, a mutable default value is easily corrupted when one invocation of the function mutates the default, changing the behavior of further invocations\u2014an issue we\u2019ll explore in \u201cMutable Types as Parameter Defaults: Bad Idea\u201d (Chapter 6).
