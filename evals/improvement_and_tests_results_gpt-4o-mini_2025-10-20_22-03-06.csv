The function `f` is designed to perform a calculation that generates a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci-like series. It takes several parameters to control its behavior, including the number of terms to generate (`n`), and it can optionally print messages based on the state of the computation. The function also handles edge cases for different values of `n` and provides feedback through print statements.

Public API
The public API of the function consists of a single function:
- `f(a=0, b=1, n=10, x=None, c=True, *args, **kwargs)`: 
  - Parameters:
    - `a`: An integer, defaulting to 0, but not used in the calculation.
    - `b`: An integer, defaulting to 1, but not used in the calculation.
    - `n`: An integer that determines how many terms of the sequence to generate.
    - `x`: A list that can be used to store the generated sequence; defaults to `None`.
    - `c`: A boolean flag that controls whether the function performs its main logic or exits early.
    - `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments that are not utilized in the function.

Variables and Their Roles
- `a`: An integer parameter that is not utilized in the function's logic.
- `b`: An integer parameter that is not utilized in the function's logic.
- `n`: An integer that specifies the number of terms to generate in the sequence.
- `x`: A list that stores the generated sequence; initialized to an empty list if not provided.
- `z`: A temporary variable used to accumulate the sum of the last two elements of the list `x` during the loop.
- `i`, `j`, `k`: Loop control variables used for iterating through ranges and lists.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function begins with a series of conditionals to handle different cases based on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list.
  - If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing only 0.
  - If `n` is 2, it appends 0 and 1 to the list `x`.
  - For `n` greater than 2, it initializes `x` with 0 and 1, then enters a loop to generate the next terms by summing the last two elements of `x`.
- A nested loop is used to sum the last two elements of `x`, but it is unnecessarily complex and could be simplified.
- There are additional conditionals to check the length of `x` and print messages based on its state.
- The function concludes with a return statement that outputs the list `x`.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` do not convey their purpose, leading to confusion about their roles in the function.
- **Dead Code**: The loop `for k in range(0):` is never executed, indicating that it is unnecessary and should be removed.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a bare `except` in the nested loop is poor practice as it can catch unexpected exceptions, making debugging difficult.
- **Print Statements**: The function relies heavily on print statements for feedback, which is not ideal for a function that may be used in a larger application. A logging mechanism would be more appropriate.
- **Complexity**: The nested loop for summing the last two elements of `x` is overly complicated and could be simplified to improve readability and performance.
- **Missing Docstrings**: The function lacks a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value, which would enhance maintainability and usability.","[{""score"": 0.12957259, ""page"": 480, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p480_c1"", ""text"": ""return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1) if __name__ == '__main__': print(fibonacci(6)) Here is the result of running fibo_demo.py.

In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class. Please read it very carefully. I worked hard on the style and structure and hope it is worth emulating.

In the same conversation, Alex Martelli suggests the reduce built-in in Python 2 was more trouble than it was worth, because it encouraged coding idioms that were hard to explain.

The purpose of the provided code is to generate a factorial calculation function. It includes a nested function `factorialFunction` that computes the factorial of a given integer, and another function `fact` that serves as a public interface for users to compute the factorial while handling input validation and error management. The code also includes backward compatibility functions for legacy support.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `generate_factorial()`: This function returns the `fact` function, which is the main interface for calculating factorials.
2. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A nested function within `generate_factorial` that computes the factorial recursively.
3. `fact(x)`: A nested function within `generate_factorial` that validates input and calls `factorialFunction`.
4. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A standalone function for backward compatibility that calls the `generate_factorial` function.
5. `fact(x)`: Another standalone function for backward compatibility that also calls `generate_factorial`.

Variables and Their Roles
- `n`: An integer input for which the factorial is to be calculated.
- `acc`: An accumulator used in the recursive calculation of the factorial (default is 1).
- `x`: The input to the `fact` function, which is validated before being processed.
- `result`: A variable in `factorialFunction` that accumulates the product of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `temp`: A control variable in `fact` that manages the retry mechanism in case of errors during factorial calculation.
- `val`: The result of the factorial calculation returned by `factorialFunction`.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The `fact` function contains several conditionals to validate the input `x`:
  - Checks if `x` is an integer.
  - Checks if `x` is negative and converts it to positive.
  - Checks if `x` is equal to 99999 and prints a warning.
- A `while` loop is used to retry the factorial calculation in case of an exception. It attempts to call `factorialFunction` and sets `temp` to 2 upon success, or increments `temp` upon failure.
- The `factorialFunction` uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial iteratively, while also printing a message when it is almost done.
- The data flow primarily moves from `fact` to `factorialFunction`, with results being printed and returned at various stages.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The function names and variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `temp` does not convey its purpose clearly.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a bare `except` clause is a bad practice as it can catch unexpected exceptions, making debugging difficult.
- **Redundant Code**: The `factorialFunction` is defined twice, once as a nested function and once as a standalone function for backward compatibility, which can lead to confusion.
- **Print Statements**: The use of print statements for debugging and status updates is not ideal for production code. A logging mechanism would be more appropriate.
- **Missing Docstrings**: There are no docstrings for any of the functions, which makes it difficult to understand their purpose and usage without reading the code.
- **Complexity**: The `factorialFunction` is overly complex with unnecessary recursion and could be simplified to improve readability and maintainability.","[{""score"": 0.24085516, ""page"": 476, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p476_c1"", ""text"": ""import time from clockdeco0 import clock @clock def snooze(seconds): time.sleep(seconds) @clock def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1) if __name__ == '__main__': print('*' * 40, 'Calling snooze(.123)') snooze(.123) print('*' * 40, 'Calling factorial(6)') print('6! =', factorial(6)) The output of running Example 9-15 looks like this: $ python3 clockdeco_demo.py **************************************** Calling snooze(.123) [0.12363791s] snooze(0.123) -> None **************************************** Calling factorial(6) [0.00000095s] factorial(1) -> 1 [0.00002408s] factorial(2) -> 2 [0.00003934s] factorial(3) -> 6 [0.00005221s] factorial(4) -> 24 [0.00006390s] factorial(5) -> 120 [0.00008297s] factorial(6) -> 720 6! = 720 How It Works Remember that this code: @clock def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1) Actually does this: def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1)""}, {""score"": 0.24056801, ""page"": 477, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p477_c1"", ""text"": ""factorial = clock(factorial) So, in both examples, clock gets the factorial function as its func argument (see Example 9-14).

Create and test a function, then read its __doc__ and check its type >>> def factorial(n): ... \""\""\""returns n!\""\""\"" ... return 1 if n < 2 else n * factorial(n - 1) ... >>> factorial(42) 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000 >>> factorial.__doc__ 'returns n!' >>> type(factorial) <class 'function'> This is a console session, so we\u2019re creating a function at \u201cruntime.\u201d __doc__ is one of several attributes of function objects. factorial is an instance of the function class. The __doc__ attribute is used to generate the help text of an object. In the Python console, the command help(factorial) will display a screen like Figure 7-1.""}, {""score"": 0.14823544, ""page"": 364, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p364_c1"", ""text"": ""Figure 7-1. Help screen for factorial; the text is built from the __doc__ attribute of the function. Example 7-2 shows the \u201cfirst class\u201d nature of a function object. We can assign it a variable fact and call it through that name. We can also pass factorial as an argument to the map function. Calling map(function, iterable) returns an iterable where each item is the result of calling the first argument (a function) to successive elements of the second argument (an iterable), range(10) in this example. Example 7-2. Use function through a different name, and pass function as argument >>> fact = factorial >>> fact <function factorial at 0x...> >>> fact(5) 120 >>> map(factorial, range(11)) <map object at 0x...> >>> list(map(factorial, range(11))) [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800] Having first-class functions enables programming in a functional style. One of the hallmarks of functional programming is the use of higher-order functions, our next topic.

In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

The purpose of the `calcularPiLeibniz` function is to calculate an approximation of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the Leibniz formula. This formula approximates π by summing a series of terms that alternate in sign. The function also has the capability to return the result in different formats based on the `PRECISION` parameter.

Public API
The public API consists of the following function:
- `calcularPiLeibniz(terms=""100"", PRECISION=None, *args, **kargs)`: This function computes an approximation of π using the Leibniz series. It accepts:
  - `terms`: A string or number indicating how many terms to use in the calculation.
  - `PRECISION`: An optional parameter that determines the format of the returned value (string, integer, or float).
  - `*args` and `**kargs`: Additional arguments that are ignored in the current implementation.

Variables and Their Roles
- `acc`: A global variable that accumulates the sum of the series terms to approximate π.
- `terms`: The input parameter that specifies the number of terms to use in the calculation.
- `t`: A local variable that holds the integer value of `terms` after conversion.
- `k`: A local variable used as a counter in the while loop to track the number of terms processed.
- `sgn`: A local variable that alternates between 1 and -1 to manage the sign of each term in the series.
- `weird`: A list that collects string representations of the terms, although it is not used meaningfully in the calculation.
- `den`: A local variable that represents the denominator of each term in the series.
- `pi_fake`: A local variable that holds the current approximation of π.
- `extra`: A variable that attempts to sum elements from the `weird` list, which is always zero in this context.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The main logic is contained within a `while True` loop that continues until certain conditions are met:
  - If `t` is -1 and `k` exceeds 42, the loop breaks.
  - If `t` is not -1 and `k` reaches `t`, the loop also breaks.
- Inside the loop, the function calculates each term of the series, updates the global accumulator `acc`, and prints the current approximation of π every 333 iterations if `PRECISION` is not set to False.
- The loop increments `k` by 1, with an additional confusing increment that serves no purpose.
- After the loop, the function attempts to calculate an ""extra"" value from the `weird` list, which is always zero, and adds it to the accumulated value.
- Finally, the function returns the approximation of π in a format determined by the `PRECISION` parameter.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: Variable names like `weird`, `pi_fake`, and `terms` do not clearly convey their purpose, leading to confusion.
- **Magic Numbers**: The use of arbitrary values like 42 and 999999999 without explanation makes the code less readable and maintainable.
- **Global State**: The use of a global variable `acc` can lead to unintended side effects and makes the function less predictable.
- **Redundant Code**: The `weird` list and the `extra` calculation are unnecessary and do not contribute to the final result.
- **Error Handling**: The function swallows exceptions and returns a hardcoded value (3.14) without providing context, which can obscure debugging.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The docstring is vague and does not adequately describe the function's behavior, parameters, or return values.
- **Side Effects**: The function has print statements that can produce output during execution, which is generally not advisable in a calculation function.","[{""score"": 0.23333538, ""page"": 465, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p465_c1"", ""text"": ""Traceback (most recent call last): File \""<stdin>\"", line 1, in <module> File \""<stdin>\"", line 3, in f2 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment Note that the output starts with 3, which proves that the print(a) statement was executed. But the second one, print(b), never runs. When I first saw this I was surprised, thinking that 6 should be printed, because there is a global variable b and the assignment to the local b is made after print(b). But the fact is, when Python compiles the body of the function, it decides that b is a local variable because it is assigned within the function. The generated bytecode reflects this decision and will try to fetch b from the local scope. Later, when the call f2(3) is made, the body of f2 fetches and prints the value of the local variable a, but when trying to fetch the value of local variable b it discovers that b is unbound. This is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing. If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable and still assign a new value to it within the function, we use the global declaration: >>> b = 6 >>> def f3(a): ... global b ... print(a) ... print(b) ... b = 9 ... >>> f3(3) 3 6 >>> b 9""}, {""score"": 0.20636007, ""page"": 471, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p471_c1"", ""text"": ""Note that series is a local variable of make_averager because the assignment series = [] happens in the body of that function.

This is a technical term meaning a variable that is not bound in the local scope. See Figure 9-1. Figure 9-1. The closure for averager extends the scope of that function to include the binding for the free variable series.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class.

The purpose of the `hanoi_m4l` function is to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem, a classic algorithmic challenge. However, the implementation is intentionally convoluted and misleading, claiming to use quantum AI to solve the problem in constant time, which is false. The function also modifies a global state and has side effects such as printing output, making it difficult to use in a predictable manner.

Public API
The public API consists of two functions:
1. `hanoi_m4l(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: This function attempts to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem with various parameters, including the number of disks, source, auxiliary, and destination pegs, a mutable memoization list, and a verbosity flag.
2. `execute(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: This function serves as a wrapper to call `hanoi_m4l` with the same parameters, facilitating functional testing.

Variables and Their Roles
- `H4N0I_STATE`: A global variable used to store the state of the Hanoi solution, which can change types unexpectedly (e.g., list, set).
- `MAGIC_NUM`: A constant set to 42, used in the logic but without clear purpose.
- `n`: Represents the number of disks, which can be a string, integer, or other types, leading to type conversion issues.
- `src`, `aux`, `dst`: Strings representing the names of the pegs, which are inconsistently used throughout the function.
- `memo`: A mutable list used for caching, which is not clearly defined in its purpose.
- `loud`: A boolean flag that controls whether to print output during execution.
- `disKs`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `acc`: Local variables within the inner function `g`, representing the current state of the recursion and the accumulator for moves.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function contains several conditionals to handle type conversions and control flow, including checks for the type of `n` and the state of `H4N0I_STATE`.
- The inner function `g` is recursive and includes base cases and additional logic that is convoluted and often leads to dead code.
- There is a loop that iterates zero times, which serves no purpose.
- The data flow is chaotic, with frequent type changes and side effects, making it difficult to trace the logic and understand the output.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Global Variables**: The use of `H4N0I_STATE` as a global variable introduces side effects and state management issues.
- **Poor Naming**: Variable names like `H4N0I_STATE`, `g`, and `MAGIC_NUM` are unclear and do not convey their purpose effectively.
- **Type Inconsistency**: The function accepts various types for `n` and other parameters, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- **Side Effects**: The function prints output and modifies global state, which can lead to unexpected results.
- **Mutable Defaults**: The use of a mutable default argument (`memo`) can lead to unintended behavior across multiple calls.
- **Shadowing Built-ins**: The function shadows built-in names like `list` and `sum`, which can lead to confusion and errors.
- **Redundant Logic**: There are sections of code that are never executed or serve no purpose, such as the zero-iteration loop and the dead code at the end.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The docstring is misleading and does not accurately describe the function's behavior, and there are no comments explaining the logic clearly.","[{""score"": 0.14163548, ""page"": 465, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p465_c1"", ""text"": ""Traceback (most recent call last): File \""<stdin>\"", line 1, in <module> File \""<stdin>\"", line 3, in f2 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment Note that the output starts with 3, which proves that the print(a) statement was executed.

But the fact is, when Python compiles the body of the function, it decides that b is a local variable because it is assigned within the function. The generated bytecode reflects this decision and will try to fetch b from the local scope. Later, when the call f2(3) is made, the body of f2 fetches and prints the value of the local variable a, but when trying to fetch the value of local variable b it discovers that b is unbound. This is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing. If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable and still assign a new value to it within the function, we use the global declaration: >>> b = 6 >>> def f3(a): ... global b ... print(a) ... print(b) ... b = 9 ... >>> f3(3) 3 6 >>> b 9""}, {""score"": 0.12322864, ""page"": 59, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p59_c1"", ""text"": ""28 Chapter 2: Meaningful Names Imagine that you have variables named firstName, lastName, street, houseNumber, city, state, and zipcode. Taken together it\u2019 s pretty clear that they form an address. But what if you just saw the state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically infer that it was part of an address? Y ou can add context by using pre\ufb01xes: addrFirstName, addrLastName, addrState, and so on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named Address. Then, even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept. Consider the method in Listing 2-1. Do the variables need a more meaningful con- text? The function name provides only part of the context; the algorithm provides the rest. Once you read through the function, you see that the three variables, number, verb, and pluralModifier, are part of the \u201cguess statistics\u201d message. Unfortunately, the context must be inferred. When you \ufb01rst look at the method, the meanings of the variables are opaque. The function is a bit too long and the variables are used throughout. To split the func- tion into smaller pieces we need to create a GuessStatisticsMessage class and make the three variables \ufb01elds of this class. This provides a clear context for the three variables. They are de\ufb01nitively part of the GuessStatisticsMessage. The improvement of context also allows the algorithm to be made much cleaner by breaking it into man y smaller functions. (See Listing 2-2.)

If you have been pro- gramming for more than a few years, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a double-take on an argument that was actually an output rather than an input. For example: appendFooter(s); Does this function append s as the footer to something? Or does it append some footer to s? Is s an input or an output? It doesn\u2019t take long to look at the function signature and see: public void appendFooter(StringBuffer report) This clari\ufb01es the issue, but only at the expense of checking the declaration of the function. Anything that forces you to check the function signature is equivalent to a double-take. It\u2019 s a cognitive break and should be avoided. In the days before object oriented programming it was sometimes necessary to have output arguments. However, much of the need for output arguments disappears in OO lan- guages because this is intended to act as an output argument. In other words, it would be better for appendFooter to be invoked as report.appendFooter(); In general output arguments should be avoided. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of its owning object. Command Query Separation Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion. Consider, for example, the following function: public boolean set(String attribute, String value); This function sets the value of a named attribute and returns true if it is successful and false if no such attribute exists.

The code is intended to convert decimal numbers into their Roman numeral representations. However, it is poorly structured and contains numerous design flaws, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The presence of global variables, inconsistent data structures, and side effects complicates its functionality.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `decimal_to_roman(number, bag=[], options={""verbose"": False}, secret=None)`: Converts a decimal number to a Roman numeral, with various options for behavior and logging.
2. `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`: A wrapper function that attempts to convert the input to an integer and then calls `decimal_to_roman`.

Variables and Their Roles
- **Global Variables**:
  - `GLOBAL_ROMAN`: Unused global variable.
  - `global_counter`: Tracks the number of times `_unrelated_side_effect` is called.
  - `LOGGING`: A flag to enable or disable logging.
  - `global_cache`: A dictionary used for caching results, but with inconsistent key types.
  
- **Constants**:
  - `A` to `M`: Magic numbers representing values in Roman numeral conversion, but poorly named and not self-explanatory.

- **Mapping Tables**:
  - `ROMANS_MAYBE` and `ROMANS_ALSO`: Two inconsistent data structures (tuples vs lists) that map decimal values to Roman numeral symbols.

- **Local Variables**:
  - `sum`: Accumulates values but serves no useful purpose.
  - `result`: Stores the final Roman numeral string.
  - `x`: A copy of the input number for processing.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The main processing occurs in a `while` loop that iterates over the mapping table. 
- The loop attempts to match the input number against values in the mapping table to build the Roman numeral string.
- There are several conditionals that check for various states, including:
  - Input validation (e.g., checking if the number is zero or negative).
  - Caching logic to return previously computed results.
  - Redundant conditions that do not affect the flow (e.g., `if x != 0 or x == 0`).
- The function also contains a recursive call to itself under certain conditions, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to the output.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Long Methods**: The `decimal_to_roman` function is overly complex and lengthy, making it hard to follow.
- **Unclear Names**: Variable names like `bag`, `sum`, and `id` are misleading or shadow built-in functions, leading to confusion.
- **Missing Docstrings**: While `decimal_to_roman` has a docstring, it is vague and does not adequately describe the function's behavior or parameters.
- **Global State**: The use of global variables introduces side effects that can lead to unpredictable behavior.
- **Inconsistent Data Structures**: The use of both tuples and lists for mapping creates confusion and potential errors.
- **Redundant Logic**: There are multiple instances of unnecessary checks and operations, such as the dead branch `if False:` and the pointless recursion.
- **Bare Except**: The use of a bare `except` statement in `decimal_to_roman` is a poor practice as it swallows all exceptions without handling them appropriately.","[{""score"": 0.115867525, ""page"": 343, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p343_c1"", ""text"": ""312 Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics the terms from this language extensively. In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

The generated bytecode reflects this decision and will try to fetch b from the local scope. Later, when the call f2(3) is made, the body of f2 fetches and prints the value of the local variable a, but when trying to fetch the value of local variable b it discovers that b is unbound. This is not a bug, but a design choice: Python does not require you to declare variables, but assumes that a variable assigned in the body of a function is local. This is much better than the behavior of JavaScript, which does not require variable declarations either, but if you do forget to declare that a variable is local (with var), you may clobber a global variable without knowing. If we want the interpreter to treat b as a global variable and still assign a new value to it within the function, we use the global declaration: >>> b = 6 >>> def f3(a): ... global b ... print(a) ... print(b) ... b = 9 ... >>> f3(3) 3 6 >>> b 9""}, {""score"": 0.104113564, ""page"": 1251, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p1251_c1"", ""text"": ""Chapter Summary We started our coverage of dynamic attributes by showing practical examples of simple classes to make it easier to deal with a JSON dataset. The first example was the FrozenJSON class that converted nested dicts and lists into nested FrozenJSON instances and lists of them. The FrozenJSON code demonstrated the use of the __getattr__ special method to convert data structures on the fly, whenever their attributes were read. The last version of FrozenJSON showcased the use of the __new__ constructor method to transform a class into a flexible factory of objects, not limited to instances of itself. We then converted the JSON dataset to a dict storing instances of a Record class. The first rendition of Record was a few lines long and introduced the \u201cbunch\u201d idiom: using self.__dict__.update(**kwargs) to build arbitrary attributes from keyword arguments passed to __init__. The second iteration added the Event class implementing automatic retrieval of linked records through properties. Computed property values sometimes require caching, and we covered a few ways of doing that. After realizing that @functools.cached_property does not implement the basic behavior expected of methods decorated with the @property built-in, we finally settled on the use of @cached_property in one method, and @functools.cache decorated with @property in the other method. Coverage of properties continued with the LineItem class, where a property was deployed to protect a weight attribute from negative or zero values that make no business sense. After a deeper look at property syntax and semantics, we created a property factory to enforce the same validation on weight and price, without coding multiple getters and setters. The property factory leveraged subtle concepts\u2014such as closures and the instance attribute overriding by properties\u2014to provide an elegant generic solution using the same number of lines as a single hand-coded property definition.""}, {""score"": 0.10300614, ""page"": 1005, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p1005_c1"", ""text"": ""Compute the next activation time by adding the sim_time and the result of calling compute_duration(\u2026) with the previous action (e.g., 'pick up passenger', 'drop off passenger', etc.) Send the time to the taxi coroutine.

Otherwise, put the next_event in the queue. If the loop exits because the simulation time passed, display the number of events pending (which may be zero by coincidence, sometimes). Linking back to Chapter 18, note that the Simulator.run method in Example 19-23 uses else blocks in two places that are not if statements: The main while loop has an else statement to report that the simulation ended because the end_time was reached\u2014and not because there were no more events to process. The try statement at the bottom of the while loop tries to get a next_event by sending the next_time to the current taxi process, and if that is successful the else block puts the next_event into the self.events queue. I believe the code in Simulator.run would be a bit harder to read without those else blocks. The point of this example was to show a main loop processing events and driving coroutines by sending data to them. This is the basic idea behind asyncio, which we\u2019ll study in Chapter 22.
