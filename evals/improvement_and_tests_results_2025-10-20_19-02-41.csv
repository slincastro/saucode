The function `f` is designed to perform a calculation that appears to generate a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci-like series. It takes several parameters to control its behavior, including the number of terms to generate (`n`), an optional list to store results (`x`), and a flag (`c`) to determine whether to proceed with the calculation. The function also includes print statements for debugging and user feedback.

Public API
The public API consists of the following function:
- `f(a=0, b=1, n=10, x=None, c=True, *args, **kwargs)`: This function generates a sequence based on the Fibonacci-like logic. It accepts:
  - `a`: An integer (default 0) that is not used in the calculation.
  - `b`: An integer (default 1) that is also not used in the calculation.
  - `n`: An integer (default 10) that specifies how many terms to generate.
  - `x`: An optional list to store the generated sequence.
  - `c`: A boolean (default True) that controls whether the function performs the calculation.
  - `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments that are not utilized in the function.

Variables and Their Roles
- `a`: An integer parameter that is not utilized in the function's logic.
- `b`: An integer parameter that is also not utilized in the function's logic.
- `n`: An integer that determines the number of terms to generate in the sequence.
- `x`: A list that stores the generated sequence. If not provided, it is initialized as an empty list.
- `c`: A boolean flag that, when set to False, prevents the calculation from proceeding.
- `z`: A temporary variable used to accumulate the sum of the last two elements in the list `x` during the loop.
- `i`, `j`, `k`: Loop control variables used for iterating through ranges.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function begins with a series of conditionals to handle different cases based on the value of `n` and the flag `c`.
- If `c` is False, the function prints a message and returns `None`.
- If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list. If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing only 0. If `n` is 2, it appends 0 and 1 to `x`.
- For `n` greater than 2, it initializes `x` with 0 and 1, then enters a loop to calculate the next terms by summing the last two elements of `x` and appending the result to `x`.
- There is a nested loop that attempts to sum the last two elements of `x`, but it is wrapped in a try-except block that catches any exceptions, printing an error message if one occurs.
- After the loop, the function checks the length of `x` and prints a message if it exceeds 9999.
- Finally, it prints the result or an error message based on the length of `x`.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` do not convey their purpose clearly. More descriptive names would improve readability.
- **Dead Code**: The loop `for k in range(0):` is never executed, indicating that it is unnecessary and should be removed.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a broad `try-except` block without specific exception handling can obscure the source of errors and is generally considered a bad practice.
- **Print Statements**: The function relies heavily on print statements for feedback, which may not be suitable for production code. Consider using logging instead.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The function lacks docstrings, making it difficult for other developers to understand its purpose and usage without reading through the code.
- **Complexity**: The function could benefit from refactoring to reduce complexity, particularly in the nested loops and conditionals.","[{""score"": 0.1199766, ""page"": 480, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p480_c1"", ""text"": ""return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1) if __name__ == '__main__': print(fibonacci(6)) Here is the result of running fibo_demo.py.

In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences.

Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long.

    return create_factorial_calculator(n)","Purpose
The purpose of the provided code is to generate a factorial calculation function. It includes a nested function `factorialFunction` that computes the factorial of a given integer, and another function `fact` that serves as a public interface for users to compute the factorial while handling input validation and error management. The code also includes backward compatibility functions for legacy support.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `generate_factorial()`: This function returns the `fact` function, which is the main interface for calculating factorials.
2. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A private function that computes the factorial recursively but is not intended to be called directly by users.
3. `fact(x)`: A private function that validates input and calls `factorialFunction` to compute the factorial.
4. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A backward compatibility function that allows users to call the factorial calculation directly.
5. `fact(x)`: Another backward compatibility function that allows users to call the factorial calculation directly.

Variables and Their Roles
- `n`: Represents the integer input for which the factorial is to be calculated.
- `acc`: An accumulator used in the recursive calculation of the factorial.
- `x`: The input to the `fact` function, which is validated before being processed.
- `result`: A local variable in `factorialFunction` that stores the intermediate product of the factorial calculation.
- `temp`: A control variable in `fact` that manages the retry mechanism in case of errors during the factorial calculation.
- `val`: A variable that stores the result of the factorial calculation returned by `factorialFunction`.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The `fact` function contains several conditionals to validate the input:
  - It checks if `x` is an integer.
  - It checks if `x` is negative and converts it to positive.
  - It checks if `x` is equal to 99999 and prints a warning.
- A `while` loop is used to retry the factorial calculation in case of an error. The loop continues until `temp` is set to 2, indicating a successful calculation.
- Inside the `factorialFunction`, a `for` loop iterates from 1 to `n`, calculating the factorial by multiplying the current result by `i`.
- The data flow primarily moves from the `fact` function to `factorialFunction`, with results being printed and returned at various stages.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The function names and variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `temp` does not convey its purpose clearly.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a bare `except` clause is a bad practice as it can catch unexpected exceptions, making debugging difficult.
- **Redundant Code**: The `factorialFunction` is defined twice, once as a nested function and once for backward compatibility, which can lead to confusion.
- **Print Statements**: The use of print statements for debugging and error messages is not ideal for production code. A logging framework would be more appropriate.
- **Missing Docstrings**: There are no docstrings for any of the functions, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage without reading the code.
- **Complex Logic**: The logic in `factorialFunction` is convoluted, particularly the recursive call and the use of an accumulator, which could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.","[{""score"": 0.24085516, ""page"": 476, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p476_c1"", ""text"": ""import time from clockdeco0 import clock @clock def snooze(seconds): time.sleep(seconds) @clock def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1) if __name__ == '__main__': print('*' * 40, 'Calling snooze(.123)') snooze(.123) print('*' * 40, 'Calling factorial(6)') print('6! =', factorial(6)) The output of running Example 9-15 looks like this: $ python3 clockdeco_demo.py **************************************** Calling snooze(.123) [0.12363791s] snooze(0.123) -> None **************************************** Calling factorial(6) [0.00000095s] factorial(1) -> 1 [0.00002408s] factorial(2) -> 2 [0.00003934s] factorial(3) -> 6 [0.00005221s] factorial(4) -> 24 [0.00006390s] factorial(5) -> 120 [0.00008297s] factorial(6) -> 720 6! = 720 How It Works Remember that this code: @clock def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1) Actually does this: def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1)""}, {""score"": 0.24056801, ""page"": 477, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p477_c1"", ""text"": ""factorial = clock(factorial) So, in both examples, clock gets the factorial function as its func argument (see Example 9-14).

Create and test a function, then read its __doc__ and check its type >>> def factorial(n): ... \""\""\""returns n!\""\""\"" ... return 1 if n < 2 else n * factorial(n - 1) ... >>> factorial(42) 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000 >>> factorial.__doc__ 'returns n!' >>> type(factorial) <class 'function'> This is a console session, so we\u2019re creating a function at \u201cruntime.\u201d __doc__ is one of several attributes of function objects. factorial is an instance of the function class. The __doc__ attribute is used to generate the help text of an object. In the Python console, the command help(factorial) will display a screen like Figure 7-1.""}, {""score"": 0.10513811, ""page"": 343, ""chunk_id"": ""cc_knowledge_book.pdf:p343_c1"", ""text"": ""312 Chapter 17: Smells and Heuristics the terms from this language extensively. In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

    return pi_approximation","Purpose
The purpose of the `calcularPiLeibniz` function is to calculate an approximation of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the Leibniz formula. The function allows for a variable number of terms to be used in the calculation, and it can return the result in different formats based on the `PRECISION` parameter. The function also has side effects, such as printing intermediate results and using a global variable for accumulation.

Public API
The public API consists of the following function:
- `calcularPiLeibniz(terms=""100"", PRECISION=None, *args, **kargs)`: This function computes an approximation of π using the Leibniz series. It accepts:
  - `terms`: A string or number indicating how many terms to use in the calculation.
  - `PRECISION`: A parameter that determines the format of the returned value (string, integer, or float).
  - `*args` and `**kargs`: Additional parameters that are ignored in the current implementation.

Variables and Their Roles
- `acc`: A global variable used to accumulate the sum of the series terms.
- `terms`: The input parameter that specifies the number of terms to use for the calculation.
- `PRECISION`: The input parameter that determines the format of the output.
- `t`: A local variable that holds the processed value of `terms`, converted to an integer or set to a default value.
- `k`: A local variable used as a counter in the while loop to track the number of terms processed.
- `sgn`: A local variable used to alternate the sign of the terms in the series.
- `weird`: A list that collects string representations of the terms, which is ultimately unused in the calculation.
- `den`: A local variable that represents the denominator of the current term in the series.
- `pi_fake`: A local variable that holds the current approximation of π.
- `extra`: A local variable that attempts to sum values from the `weird` list, which is always zero in this context.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
The function contains a `while True` loop that continues until certain conditions are met:
- If `t` is -1 and `k` exceeds 42, the loop breaks.
- If `t` is not -1 and `k` reaches `t`, the loop breaks.

Inside the loop:
- The denominator is calculated, and the term is computed and added to the global accumulator `acc`.
- The sign is alternated for the next term.
- Every 333 iterations, if `PRECISION` is not `False`, an intermediate approximation of π is printed.
- The loop also contains a confusing increment of `k` that adds 1 to `k` if it reaches 999999999, which serves no clear purpose.

After the loop, there is an attempt to calculate an `extra` value from the `weird` list, which is always zero, and this value is added to the final approximation of π. The function then returns the result based on the `PRECISION` parameter.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: Variable names like `weird`, `t`, and `pi_fake` do not clearly convey their purpose, making the code harder to understand.
- **Global Variable Usage**: The use of a global variable (`acc`) for accumulation can lead to unintended side effects and makes the function less predictable.
- **Magic Numbers**: The use of arbitrary values like `42` and `999999999` without explanation can confuse readers and maintainers of the code.
- **Redundant Code**: The list `weird` is created but never used meaningfully, and the attempt to sum its elements is always zero.
- **Error Handling**: The function swallows exceptions and returns a hardcoded value (3.14) without providing context, which can obscure the source of errors.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The docstring is vague and does not adequately describe the function's behavior, parameters, or return values.
- **Side Effects**: The function has print statements that can lead to unexpected output during execution, which is generally discouraged in pure functions.","[{""score"": 0.20172602, ""page"": 471, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p471_c1"", ""text"": ""Note that series is a local variable of make_averager because the assignment series = [] happens in the body of that function.

We did not have this problem in Example 9-8 because we never assigned to the series name; we only called series.append and invoked sum and len on it. So we took advantage of the fact that lists are mutable. But with immutable types like numbers, strings, tuples, etc., all you can do is read, never update. If you try to rebind them, as in count = count + 1, then you are implicitly creating a local variable count. It is no longer a free variable, and therefore it is not saved in the closure.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class.

The purpose of the `hanoi_m4l` function is to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem, a classic algorithmic challenge. However, the implementation is intentionally convoluted and misleading, claiming to use quantum AI to solve the problem in constant time, which is false. The function also modifies a global state and has side effects such as printing output, making it difficult to use in a predictable manner.

Public API
The public API consists of two functions:
1. `hanoi_m4l(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: This function attempts to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem with various parameters, including the number of disks, source, auxiliary, and destination pegs, a mutable memoization list, and a verbosity flag.
2. `execute(n, src, aux, dst, memo, loud, *args, **kwargs)`: This function serves as a wrapper to call `hanoi_m4l` with the same parameters, facilitating functional testing.

Variables and Their Roles
- `H4N0I_STATE`: A global variable used to store the state of the Hanoi solution, which can change types unexpectedly.
- `MAGIC_NUM`: A constant set to 42, used in the logic of the function but without clear purpose.
- `n`: Represents the number of disks, which can be a string, integer, or other types, leading to type conversion issues.
- `src`, `aux`, `dst`: Strings representing the names of the pegs, which are inconsistently used throughout the function.
- `memo`: A mutable list used for caching, which is not clearly defined in its purpose.
- `loud`: A boolean flag that controls whether the function prints output.
- `disKs`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `acc`: Local variables within the inner function `g`, representing the current state of the recursion and the accumulator for moves.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function contains several conditionals to handle type conversions and control flow, including checks for the type of `n` and the state of `H4N0I_STATE`.
- The inner function `g` is recursive and includes base cases and additional logic that is convoluted and often leads to dead code.
- There is a loop that iterates zero times, which serves no purpose.
- The data flow is chaotic, with the function returning different types (string or list) based on the parity of `n`, and the global state being modified throughout the execution.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Global Variables**: The use of `H4N0I_STATE` as a global variable leads to unpredictable behavior and side effects.
- **Poor Naming**: Variable names like `H4N0I_STATE`, `g`, and `MAGIC_NUM` are unclear and do not convey their purpose effectively.
- **Type Inconsistency**: The function accepts and processes various types for `n`, leading to potential runtime errors and confusion.
- **Side Effects**: The function prints output and modifies global state, which can lead to unexpected results when used in different contexts.
- **Dead Code**: There are sections of code that will never execute, such as the loop that iterates zero times and the unreachable return statement.
- **Use of `eval` and `exec`**: The use of `eval` to manipulate variables and `exec` to execute arbitrary code is dangerous and unnecessary.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The docstring is misleading and does not accurately describe the function's behavior, and there are no comments explaining the logic.
- **Exception Handling**: The function swallows exceptions without providing meaningful error messages, making debugging difficult.","[{""score"": 0.15598574, ""page"": 465, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p465_c1"", ""text"": ""Traceback (most recent call last): File \""<stdin>\"", line 1, in <module> File \""<stdin>\"", line 3, in f2 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment Note that the output starts with 3, which proves that the print(a) statement was executed.

Taken together it\u2019 s pretty clear that they form an address. But what if you just saw the state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically infer that it was part of an address? Y ou can add context by using pre\ufb01xes: addrFirstName, addrLastName, addrState, and so on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named Address. Then, even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept. Consider the method in Listing 2-1. Do the variables need a more meaningful con- text? The function name provides only part of the context; the algorithm provides the rest. Once you read through the function, you see that the three variables, number, verb, and pluralModifier, are part of the \u201cguess statistics\u201d message. Unfortunately, the context must be inferred. When you \ufb01rst look at the method, the meanings of the variables are opaque. The function is a bit too long and the variables are used throughout. To split the func- tion into smaller pieces we need to create a GuessStatisticsMessage class and make the three variables \ufb01elds of this class. This provides a clear context for the three variables. They are de\ufb01nitively part of the GuessStatisticsMessage. The improvement of context also allows the algorithm to be made much cleaner by breaking it into man y smaller functions. (See Listing 2-2.)

If you have been pro- gramming for more than a few years, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a double-take on an argument that was actually an output rather than an input. For example: appendFooter(s); Does this function append s as the footer to something? Or does it append some footer to s? Is s an input or an output? It doesn\u2019t take long to look at the function signature and see: public void appendFooter(StringBuffer report) This clari\ufb01es the issue, but only at the expense of checking the declaration of the function. Anything that forces you to check the function signature is equivalent to a double-take. It\u2019 s a cognitive break and should be avoided. In the days before object oriented programming it was sometimes necessary to have output arguments. However, much of the need for output arguments disappears in OO lan- guages because this is intended to act as an output argument. In other words, it would be better for appendFooter to be invoked as report.appendFooter(); In general output arguments should be avoided. If your function must change the state of something, have it change the state of its owning object. Command Query Separation Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about that object. Doing both often leads to confusion. Consider, for example, the following function: public boolean set(String attribute, String value); This function sets the value of a named attribute and returns true if it is successful and false if no such attribute exists.

The code is intended to convert decimal numbers into their Roman numeral representations. However, it is poorly structured and contains numerous design flaws, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The presence of global variables, inconsistent data structures, and side effects further complicates its functionality.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `decimal_to_roman(number, bag=[], options={""verbose"": False}, secret=None)`: Converts a decimal number to a Roman numeral, with options for verbosity and a mutable default parameter.
2. `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`: A wrapper function that attempts to convert a decimal number to a Roman numeral, re-parsing the input unnecessarily.
3. `execute(n=1)`: A function used for functional tests, which calls `convertDecimalToRoman(n)`.

Variables and Their Roles
- **Global Variables**:
  - `GLOBAL_ROMAN`: Unused global variable.
  - `global_counter`: Tracks the number of times `_unrelated_side_effect` is called.
  - `LOGGING`: A flag to enable or disable logging.
  - `global_cache`: A dictionary used for caching results, but with inconsistent key types.
  
- **Constants**:
  - `A` to `M`: Magic numbers representing values in Roman numeral conversion, but poorly named and lacking context.

- **Mapping Tables**:
  - `ROMANS_MAYBE` and `ROMANS_ALSO`: Two inconsistent data structures (tuples vs lists) that map decimal values to Roman numeral symbols.

- **Local Variables**:
  - `sum`: Accumulates values but serves no useful purpose.
  - `result`: Stores the final Roman numeral string.
  - `x`: A mutable copy of the input number for processing.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The main processing occurs in a `while` loop within `decimal_to_roman`, iterating over the mapping table to build the Roman numeral string.
- There are several conditionals that check for various states, including:
  - Input validation (e.g., checking if the number is zero or negative).
  - Caching logic to return previously computed results.
  - A redundant condition that checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `value`.
- The flow of data is convoluted due to unnecessary side effects, such as modifying the global counter and using mutable default parameters.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Long Methods**: The `decimal_to_roman` function is overly complex and lengthy, mixing multiple responsibilities.
- **Unclear Names**: Variable names like `sum`, `bag`, and `id` are misleading and do not convey their purpose clearly.
- **Missing Docstrings**: Many functions lack proper documentation, making it difficult to understand their intended use.
- **Inconsistent Data Structures**: The use of both tuples and lists for mapping tables leads to confusion and potential errors.
- **Redundant Logic**: There are unnecessary checks and operations, such as the dead branch `if False:` and the pointless recursion.
- **Mutable Default Arguments**: The use of mutable defaults (e.g., `bag=[]`) can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Bare Except**: The use of a bare `except` statement in `decimal_to_roman` is poor practice, as it swallows all exceptions without handling them appropriately.","[{""score"": 0.10690199, ""page"": 465, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p465_c1"", ""text"": ""Traceback (most recent call last): File \""<stdin>\"", line 1, in <module> File \""<stdin>\"", line 3, in f2 UnboundLocalError: local variable 'b' referenced before assignment Note that the output starts with 3, which proves that the print(a) statement was executed.

In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

The first case involves the decimal.Decimal class. You can have x != +x if x is a Decimal instance created in an arithmetic context and +x is then evaluated in a context with different settings. For example, x is calculated in a context with a certain precision, but the precision of the context is changed and then +x is evaluated. See Example 16-2 for a demonstration. Example 16-2. A change in the arithmetic context precision may cause x to differ from +x >>> import decimal >>> ctx = decimal.getcontext() >>> ctx.prec = 40 >>> one_third = decimal.Decimal('1') / decimal.Decimal('3') >>> one_third Decimal('0.3333333333333333333333333333333333333333') >>> one_third == +one_third True >>> ctx.prec = 28 >>> one_third == +one_third False >>> +one_third Decimal('0.3333333333333333333333333333') Get a reference to the current global arithmetic context. Set the precision of the arithmetic context to 40. Compute 1/3 using the current precision. Inspect the result; there are 40 digits after the decimal point. one_third == +one_third is True.

Inspect +one_third; there are 28 digits after the '.' here. The fact is that each occurrence of the expression +one_third produces a new Decimal instance from the value of one_third, but using the precision of the current arithmetic context. The second case where x != +x you can find in the collections.Counter documentation. The Counter class implements several arithmetic operators, including infix + to add the tallies from two Counter instances. However, for practical reasons, Counter addition discards from the result any item with a negative or zero count. And the prefix + is a shortcut for adding an empty Counter, therefore it produces a new Counter preserving only the tallies that are greater than zero. See Example 16-3. Example 16-3. Unary + produces a new Counter without zeroed or negative tallies >>> ct = Counter('abracadabra') >>> ct Counter({'a': 5, 'r': 2, 'b': 2, 'd': 1, 'c': 1}) >>> ct['r'] = -3 >>> ct['d'] = 0 >>> ct Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0, 'r': -3}) >>> +ct Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}) Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.

Taken together it\u2019 s pretty clear that they form an address. But what if you just saw the state variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically infer that it was part of an address? Y ou can add context by using pre\ufb01xes: addrFirstName, addrLastName, addrState, and so on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named Address. Then, even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept. Consider the method in Listing 2-1. Do the variables need a more meaningful con- text? The function name provides only part of the context; the algorithm provides the rest. Once you read through the function, you see that the three variables, number, verb, and pluralModifier, are part of the \u201cguess statistics\u201d message. Unfortunately, the context must be inferred. When you \ufb01rst look at the method, the meanings of the variables are opaque. The function is a bit too long and the variables are used throughout. To split the func- tion into smaller pieces we need to create a GuessStatisticsMessage class and make the three variables \ufb01elds of this class. This provides a clear context for the three variables. They are de\ufb01nitively part of the GuessStatisticsMessage. The improvement of context also allows the algorithm to be made much cleaner by breaking it into man y smaller functions. (See Listing 2-2.)
