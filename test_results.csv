    logging.info(execute(n=6))","Purpose
The function `f` is designed to perform a calculation that appears to generate a sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci-like series, depending on the input parameter `n`. It initializes a list `x` to store the results and handles various edge cases, such as when `n` is 0, 1, or 2. The function also includes print statements for debugging and user feedback, indicating the progress and results of the computation.

Public API
The public API of the function consists of a single function:
- `f(a=0, b=1, n=10, x=None, c=True, *args, **kwargs)`: 
  - Parameters:
    - `a`: An integer, defaulting to 0, but not used in the computation.
    - `b`: An integer, defaulting to 1, but not used in the computation.
    - `n`: An integer that determines the length of the sequence to generate.
    - `x`: A list that stores the generated sequence, defaulting to None.
    - `c`: A boolean flag that controls whether the function performs its main logic or exits early.
    - `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments that are not utilized in the function.

Variables and Their Roles
- `a`: An integer parameter that is not utilized in the function's logic.
- `b`: An integer parameter that is also not utilized in the function's logic.
- `n`: An integer that dictates how many numbers to generate in the sequence.
- `x`: A list that holds the generated sequence of numbers. It is initialized to an empty list if not provided.
- `c`: A boolean flag that determines whether the function should proceed with calculations or exit early.
- `z`: A temporary variable used to accumulate the sum of the last two elements in the list `x` during the loop.
- `i`, `j`, `k`: Loop control variables used for iterating through ranges and lists.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The function begins with a series of conditional checks:
  - If `x` is `None`, it initializes `x` as an empty list.
  - If `c` is `False`, it prints a message and returns `None`.
  - If `n` is 0, it returns an empty list.
  - If `n` is 1, it returns a list containing only 0.
  - If `n` is 2, it appends 0 and 1 to `x`.
- For `n` greater than 2, it initializes `x` with 0 and 1, then enters a loop to generate the next numbers in the sequence by summing the last two elements of `x`.
- An inner loop attempts to sum the last two elements of `x`, with a try-except block that catches any errors (though it is unclear what errors are expected).
- After generating the sequence, it checks if the length of `x` exceeds 9999 and prints a warning if so.
- Finally, it prints the result or an error message based on the length of `x`.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The function and variable names are not descriptive. For example, `f` does not convey any meaning about its purpose, and `c` is ambiguous.
- **Dead Code**: The loop `for k in range(0):` is never executed, indicating that it is unnecessary and should be removed.
- **Unused Parameters**: The parameters `a` and `b` are defined but not used in the function, which can lead to confusion.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a broad `try-except` block without specifying the exception type is not a good practice, as it can mask other issues.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The function lacks docstrings or comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values, making it difficult for other developers to understand its functionality.
- **Print Statements for Debugging**: The function relies heavily on print statements for feedback, which is not ideal for production code. A logging mechanism would be more appropriate.","[{""score"": 0.12834886, ""page"": 480, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p480_c1"", ""text"": ""return fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 1) if __name__ == '__main__': print(fibonacci(6)) Here is the result of running fibo_demo.py.

Using lru_cache The functools.cache decorator is actually a simple wrapper around the older functools.lru_cache function, which is more flexible and compatible with Python 3.8 and earlier versions.

In short, the more you can use names that are overloaded with special meanings that are relevant to your project, the easier it will be for readers to know what your code is talking about. N4: Unambiguous Names Choose names that make the workings of a function or variable unambiguous. Consider this example from FitNesse: private String doRename() throws Exception { if(refactorReferences) renameReferences(); renamePage(); pathToRename.removeNameFromEnd(); pathToRename.addNameToEnd(newName); return PathParser.render(pathToRename); } The name of this function does not say what the function does except in broad and vague terms. This is emphasized by the fact that there is a function named renamePage inside the function named doRename! What do the names tell you about the difference between the two functions? Nothing. A better name for that function is renamePageAndOptionallyAllReferences. This may seem long, and it is, but it\u2019 s only called from one place in the module, so it\u2019 s explanatory value outweighs the length. N5: Use Long Names for Long Scopes The length of a name should be related to the length of the scope. Y ou can use very short variable names for tiny scopes, but for big scopes you should use longer names. Variable names like i and j are just \ufb01ne if their scope is \ufb01ve lines long. Consider this snippet from the old standard \u201cBowling Game\u201d: private void rollMany(int n, int pins) { for (int i=0; i<n; i++) g.roll(pins); } This is perfectly clear and would be obfuscated if the variable i were replaced with some- thing annoying like rollCount. On the other hand, variables and functions with short names lose their meaning over long distances. So the longer the scope of the name, the longer and more precise the name should be.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class.

The purpose of the provided code is to generate a factorial calculation function. It includes a nested function `factorialFunction` that computes the factorial of a given integer, and another function `fact` that serves as a public interface for users to compute the factorial while handling input validation and error management. The code also includes backward compatibility functions for legacy support.

Public API
The public API consists of the following functions:
1. `generate_factorial()`: This function returns the `fact` function, which is the main interface for calculating factorials.
2. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A nested function within `generate_factorial` that computes the factorial recursively.
3. `fact(x)`: A nested function within `generate_factorial` that validates input and calls `factorialFunction`.
4. `factorialFunction(n, acc=1)`: A standalone function for backward compatibility that calls the `generate_factorial` function.
5. `fact(x)`: A standalone function for backward compatibility that also calls the `generate_factorial` function.
6. `execute(n, acc=1)`: A function used for functional tests, which is not to be modified.

Variables and Their Roles
- `n`: An integer input for which the factorial is to be calculated.
- `acc`: An accumulator used in the recursive calculation of the factorial (default is 1).
- `x`: The input to the `fact` function, which is validated before being processed.
- `result`: A variable in `factorialFunction` that accumulates the product of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `temp`: A control variable in `fact` that manages the retry mechanism in case of an error during factorial calculation.
- `val`: A variable that stores the result of the factorial calculation returned by `factorialFunction`.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The `fact` function contains several conditionals to validate the input:
  - It checks if `x` is an integer.
  - It checks if `x` is negative and converts it to positive.
  - It checks if `x` is equal to 99999 and prints a warning.
- A `while` loop is used to retry the factorial calculation in case of an error, with a maximum of two attempts.
- Inside the `factorialFunction`, a `for` loop iterates from 1 to `n`, calculating the factorial by multiplying the current result by `i`.
- The data flow primarily moves from the `fact` function to `factorialFunction`, with results being printed and returned at various stages.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The function names and variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `temp` does not convey its purpose clearly.
- **Error Handling**: The use of a bare `except` clause is a bad practice as it can catch unexpected exceptions, making debugging difficult.
- **Redundant Code**: The recursive call in `factorialFunction` is unnecessary and complicates the logic. The factorial can be computed iteratively without recursion.
- **Print Statements**: The use of print statements for debugging and status updates is not ideal for production code. A logging mechanism would be more appropriate.
- **Lack of Docstrings**: There are no docstrings for any of the functions, making it difficult to understand their purpose and usage.
- **Magic Numbers**: The number `99999` is hardcoded in the `fact` function without explanation, which can lead to confusion.
- **Potential Infinite Loop**: The `while` loop in `fact` could lead to an infinite loop if an error occurs repeatedly, as there is no limit on retries beyond the hardcoded value of `temp`.","[{""score"": 0.24085516, ""page"": 476, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p476_c1"", ""text"": ""import time from clockdeco0 import clock @clock def snooze(seconds): time.sleep(seconds) @clock def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1) if __name__ == '__main__': print('*' * 40, 'Calling snooze(.123)') snooze(.123) print('*' * 40, 'Calling factorial(6)') print('6! =', factorial(6)) The output of running Example 9-15 looks like this: $ python3 clockdeco_demo.py **************************************** Calling snooze(.123) [0.12363791s] snooze(0.123) -> None **************************************** Calling factorial(6) [0.00000095s] factorial(1) -> 1 [0.00002408s] factorial(2) -> 2 [0.00003934s] factorial(3) -> 6 [0.00005221s] factorial(4) -> 24 [0.00006390s] factorial(5) -> 120 [0.00008297s] factorial(6) -> 720 6! = 720 How It Works Remember that this code: @clock def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1) Actually does this: def factorial(n): return 1 if n < 2 else n*factorial(n-1)""}, {""score"": 0.24056801, ""page"": 477, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p477_c1"", ""text"": ""factorial = clock(factorial) So, in both examples, clock gets the factorial function as its func argument (see Example 9-14).

Treating a Function Like an Object The console session in Example 7-1 shows that Python functions are objects.

We can assign it a variable fact and call it through that name. We can also pass factorial as an argument to the map function. Calling map(function, iterable) returns an iterable where each item is the result of calling the first argument (a function) to successive elements of the second argument (an iterable), range(10) in this example. Example 7-2. Use function through a different name, and pass function as argument >>> fact = factorial >>> fact <function factorial at 0x...> >>> fact(5) 120 >>> map(factorial, range(11)) <map object at 0x...> >>> list(map(factorial, range(11))) [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800] Having first-class functions enables programming in a functional style.

If there is no error, the country code is available as the result of the await coro expression at the top of the for loop. This wraps up the discussion of an asyncio example functionally equivalent to the flags2_threadpool.py we saw earlier. While discussing Example 22-3, I noted that save_flag performs file I/O and should be executed asynchronously for better performance. The following section shows how. Using an Executor to Avoid Blocking the Event Loop In the Python community, we tend to overlook the fact that local filesystem access is blocking, rationalizing that it doesn\u2019t suffer from the higher latency of network access\u2014which is also dangerously unpredictable. In contrast, Node.js programmers are constantly reminded that all filesystem functions are blocking because their signatures require a callback. Each time event loop is blocked because of any I/O, you are wasting millions of CPU cycles. This may have a significant impact on the overall performance of the application. In Example 22-6, the blocking function is save_flag. In the threaded version of the script (Example 21-16), save_flag blocks the thread that\u2019s running the download_one function, but that\u2019s only one of several worker threads. Behind the scenes, the blocking I/O call releases the GIL, so another thread can proceed. But in flags2_asyncio.py, save_flag blocks the single thread our code shares with the asyncio event loop, therefore the whole application freezes while the file is being saved. The solution to this problem is the run_in_executor method of the event loop object. The asyncio event loop provides a thread pool executor, and you can send callables to be executed by it with loop.run_in_executor. This allows potentially blocking code to run in other threads, without blocking the event loop in the main thread or our program.""}]",6,7,2,11,16.0,4,5,2,9,9.5,ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'evals/src/exercise2_factorial/factorial_test',

The purpose of the `calcularPiLeibniz` function is to calculate an approximation of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the Leibniz formula. The function allows for a variable number of terms to be used in the calculation, and it can return the result in different formats based on the `PRECISION` parameter. The function also maintains a global accumulator variable to store the ongoing sum of the series.

Public API
The public API consists of the following function:
- `calcularPiLeibniz(terms=""100"", PRECISION=None, *args, **kargs)`: This function computes an approximation of π using the Leibniz series. It accepts:
  - `terms`: The number of terms to use in the approximation (default is ""100"").
  - `PRECISION`: Determines the format of the returned value (e.g., string, integer, or float).
  - `*args` and `**kargs`: Additional parameters that are ignored in the current implementation.

Variables and Their Roles
- `acc`: A global variable that accumulates the sum of the series to approximate π.
- `terms`: Input parameter that specifies how many terms to use in the calculation.
- `PRECISION`: Input parameter that determines the format of the output.
- `t`: A local variable that holds the integer value of `terms` after conversion.
- `k`: A local variable used as a counter in the while loop.
- `sgn`: A local variable that alternates between 1 and -1 to manage the sign of the terms in the series.
- `weird`: A list that collects string representations of the terms, which is ultimately unused in the calculation.
- `den`: A local variable that represents the denominator of the current term in the series.
- `pi_fake`: A local variable that holds the current approximation of π.
- `extra`: A local variable that attempts to sum elements from the `weird` list, which is always zero in this context.

Loops/Conditionals and Data Flow
- The main logic is contained within a `while True` loop that continues until certain conditions are met:
  - If `t` is -1 and `k` exceeds 42, the loop breaks.
  - If `t` is not -1 and `k` reaches or exceeds `t`, the loop breaks.
- Inside the loop, the function calculates each term of the series, updates the global accumulator, and alternates the sign for the next term.
- There are conditional statements that handle printing the current approximation every 333 iterations if `PRECISION` is not set to `False`.
- At the end of the loop, the function attempts to perform additional calculations using the `weird` list, which does not contribute to the final result.
- The function concludes with a return statement that formats the output based on the `PRECISION` parameter.

Any Obvious Smells
- **Unclear Names**: The variable names such as `weird`, `pi_fake`, and `terms` do not clearly convey their purpose, leading to confusion.
- **Magic Numbers**: The use of arbitrary values like `42` and `999999999` without explanation makes the code less readable and maintainable.
- **Global State**: The use of a global variable (`acc`) can lead to unintended side effects and makes the function less predictable.
- **Redundant Code**: The list `weird` is created but never used meaningfully, and the attempt to sum its elements is always zero.
- **Error Handling**: The broad exception handling that swallows all errors and returns a fixed value (3.14) can mask underlying issues and make debugging difficult.
- **Lack of Documentation**: The function lacks detailed docstrings and comments explaining the logic, especially regarding the handling of `args` and `kargs`, which are ignored.
- **Complex Logic**: The loop contains confusing increments and conditions that could be simplified for better clarity.","[{""score"": 0.21526435, ""page"": 471, ""chunk_id"": ""Fluent.Python.2nd.Edition.(z-lib.org).pdf:p471_c1"", ""text"": ""Note that series is a local variable of make_averager because the assignment series = [] happens in the body of that function.

So, of course, I decided to write my own. I call it: Args. Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input argu- ments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the argu- ments. Consider the following simple example: You can see how simple this is. We just create an instance of the Args class with two parameters. The \ufb01rst parameter is the format, or schema, string: \""l,p#,d*.\"" It de\ufb01nes three command-line arguments. The \ufb01rst, \u2013l, is a boolean argument. The second, -p, is an integer argument. The third, -d, is a string argument. The second parameter to the Args constructor is simply the array of command-line argument passed into main. If the constructor returns without throwing an ArgsException, then the incoming command-line was parsed, and the Args instance is ready to be queried. Methods like getBoolean, getInteger, and getString allow us to access the values of the arguments by their names. If there is a problem, either in the format string or in the command-line arguments themselves, an ArgsException will be thrown. A convenient description of what went wrong can be retrieved from the errorMessage method of the exception. Args Implementation Listing 14-2 is the implementation of the Args class.
